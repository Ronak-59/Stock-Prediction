A downgrade could come even if officials agree to raise the federal debt ceiling by Aug. 2. Treasury Department officials have set that as the deadline because after that date, without more borrowing authority, the government could run out of cash to pay all its bills.</br></br>Messrs. Obama and Boehner had been trying to package a deal that would reduce future federal deficits by $4 trillion over 10 years, a level S&P officials had suggested would be sufficient to avoid a downgrade. A lower credit rating would raise borrowing costs not just for the government, but also for consumers and businesses, which could slow U.S. economic growth.

842613494,6,2/9/98,New Job Data Cast Doubt on Economy's Slowing,"WASHINGTON -- The spate of new jobs created by American companies last month casts doubt over the conventional wisdom that the economy is slowing.</br></br>Most analysts have argued that the Asian financial crisis was beginning to rein in the galloping U.S. economy to a more manageable trot. But in the government's first official look at January economic activity, the Labor Department said Friday that nonfarm businesses added 358,000 workers to their payrolls. That was slightly more than were generated in December's robust job market and well above the healthy 267,000 average monthly rise through 1997.</br></br>The employment report also showed how the rising economic tide is lifting more and more boats, with joblessness falling sharply even among high-school dropouts. For the first time, the Labor Department started reporting employment data by level of education, and said the unemployment rate for people without high-school diplomas fell to 7.2% last month from 8.9% a year earlier. Even so, the numbers confirmed that education still matters a lot: the unemployment rate for college graduates was a minuscule 1.9% last month, down from 2.1% a year earlier. (The department had been collecting these figures in the past, but not posting them.)</br></br>The January unemployment rate for all workers stayed at the same 4.7% of the work force reported in December. The low jobless level continued to give workers more bargaining power, as average hourly earnings rose by four cents, to $12.51. During the past year, wages rose 3.8%, or about twice the inflation rate. The figures are adjusted for seasonal factors.</br></br>In contrast, other data released recently indicate some sort of economic slowdown. The monthly survey of manufacturers' purchasing managers released last week showed some decline in business, as did the government's report on factory orders in December. Consumer confidence is reported to have dropped sharply in January. Anecdotal evidence -- such as disappointing profit reports and job cuts at blue-chip companies -- has added to the perception of softening. Policymakers have assumed some easing from last year's torrid growth rate was imminent. That was a big reason the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady last week.",,,

842613501,4,9/9/96,"Despite Rally, Worries Over Inflation Remain --- Economists Search For Better Indicators Than the Jobs Report","NEW YORK -- It's time to call a halt to the bond market's infatuation with the monthly employment data and look further afield for new ways to detect wage inflation.</br></br>That's the argument advanced by growing numbers of economists and market participants, as Americans continue to find jobs at a steady clip and the unemployment rate drops sharply. Weary of the bond-market gyrations touched off by each monthly employment report, they have embarked on a quest for new clues about inflation. Some are even putting their faith in anecdotal evidence instead of the sometimes confounding signals from the statistical data.</br></br>""The employment numbers are becoming increasingly less relevant as the numbers of people finding jobs has grown,"" argues Nancy Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data in Boston. ""Frankly, there aren't that many people left to hire. . . . A gain of 300,000 in today's labor market is the equivalent of what would have been [a] massive gain of 700,000 jobs four years ago.""</br></br>The reason, Ms. Kimelman says, is that as the rate at which Americans find new jobs has leveled off at around 230,000 a month, the unemployment rate continues to fall and average hourly earnings continue to climb. Indeed, Friday's report showed that average hourly earnings rose six cents in August to $11.87, the highest level seen since December 1990, and the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1%. Those factors helped cap the Treasury market's ""relief"" rally, touched off when traders saw that the overall job growth was within expected bounds.</br></br>""The fixation on the `big' overall number of new jobs isn't sane,"" says one trader, disgruntled after a day of fielding more calls than he says he gets in an average week, all from clients seeking insight into a single figure.",,,

Consumer confidence slumped last month and the job market remains weak. On Thursday, the Federal Reserve reported consumer borrowing fell in May, another sign that they are wary about their finances.</br></br>All this bodes poorly for the kind of snapback in spending many stores anticipated only a few months ago. Last year's holiday sales were strong and many retailers expected robust growth to continue through this year, fueled in part by pent-up demand for washing machines and clothes that weren't bought during the recession.</br></br>The typical retailer has to place orders four months or more in advance of actual sales -- which makes them susceptible in the event that sales fail to materialize or simply grow much more slowly than expected.</br></br>Slower growth could mean stores will be stuck with excess inventory.

In fact, Treasury yields could fall further if the Federal Reserve starts buying bonds again in a widely anticipated maneuver known as ""quantitative easing.""</br></br>But step back from day-to-day market gyrations and a different picture emerges.

Treasury prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields, have surged 9.3% this year alone.</br></br>Now consider a different era: 1949 through 1979.

842613541,7,10/31/07,The Afternoon Report: Reckoning Rates,"The U.S. economy beefed up over the summer, despite weak-kneed financial and housing markets. Still, investors aren't expecting the data to keep the Federal Reserve from taking another whack at interest rates today.</br></br>In its first pass at calculating growth for the July-through- September quarter, the Commerce Department estimated that gross domestic product -- a broad measure of the economy's physique -- rose at an annual rate of 3.9%, up a tick from the second quarter's 3.8% growth and besting the guesses of 24 Wall Street shamans surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. Their consensus call was 3.2% GDP growth during the quarter. True enough, there was housing-related softness in the report, as residential investment tumbled 20% and zapped more than a percentage point of growth out of the final number. But there were plenty of off-setting bright spots, such as the undaunted millions piloting our national fleet of shopping carts. Consumer spending is the biggest component of GDP and it climbed 3% during the third quarter after posting more of a pipsqueak percentage, 1.4%, during the spring quarter. There were other signs of strength too, especially in exports, which shot up 16% thanks in part to the falling dollar, and business spending, which saw a 7.9% bump. In a separate report, U.S. construction spending unexpectedly jumped in September, with government-financed projects picking up the slack in the housing sector.</br></br>Alas, nothing is simple for Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and his elite squad of econo-wonks, who are, as of this writing, putting final flourishes on their latest masterpiece of a press release announcing their decision on interest rates. (It's due at 2:15 p.m.). The rosier- than-expected GDP and construction numbers might not have much bearing on the Fed's decision-making, which most handicappers expect will produce a quarter-percentage-point cut in the federal funds rate. That is mostly because these numbers offer a slightly stale view of the economy. ""The question now is how well it can withstand even steeper declines in residential construction, the general tightening in credit conditions, falling house prices, oil prices at around $90 per barrel, and their negative implications for consumer and business spending,"" wrote Nigel Gault, an economist with research firm Global Insight. Such stresses would help make the case for easier credit.</br></br>But not all dismal scientists discounted today's GDP figures. At Nomura Securities, analysts wrote that ""the surprising GDP strength could be enough to persuade the FOMC to defer any decision about the need for another rate cut until a clearer picture of the fourth quarter has formed."" And analysts with Bear Stearns wrapped up their GDP commentary by noting refound strength in an employment report from payroll processing giant ADP. ""With the evidence [from this morning's ADP report] suggesting that private payrolls grew around 100,000 in October, and with back-to-back quarters of near 4% real GDP growth, the economic argument for a further rate cut at this point is unclear to us.""

It should stay solvent until 2008, seven years longer than the trustees projected last April, largely because the balanced-budget law lowers Medicare spending by $115 billion in the next five years.</br></br>The Social Security trust fund, which pays retirement and other benefits to 44 million Americans each month, had been expected to go broke in 2029 as Americans live longer and the baby boom retires. But the ""strength in the U.S. economy"" has almost single-handedly bought the system another three years, said Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, a trustee. The six trustees -- two private citizens and four government officials -- oversee the financial operations of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds and report on them to Congress each year. The trustees expect lower inflation and unemployment rates, higher productivity and inflation-adjusted wage gains and a smaller decline in average hours worked in the next 10 years than they had projected in last year's report. The rosier outlook reflects both the economy's recent superlative performance and expectations about the near future. With more Americans working, payroll taxes paid to support Social Security are expected to rise more than previously thought. And with lower price inflation, yearly cost-of-living raises to retirees will likely be smaller.</br></br>As a result, the size of Social Security's projected 75-year deficit declined slightly to 2.19% of taxable payroll from the 2.23% projected last year. And the balanced-budget agreement halved Medicare's projected 75-year deficit to about 2% of taxable payroll.</br></br>The trustees' updated projections still are more conservative than the most optimistic observers: They expect the U.S. economy to grow about 2% a year on average in the next decade, about fourtenths of a percentage point slower than in the past decade.",,,

842613580,7,8/13/84,The Outlook -- After the Rise: The Market's Message,"NEW YORK -- Anyone who questions the remarkable relationship that binds the economy and the stock market should ponder briefly the circumstances that immediately preceded the recent surge in share prices. On July 31, the Commerce Department announced that its composite index of leading economic indicators dropped 0.9% in June. And on Aug. 1, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 19.33 points. Further steep increases followed, so that by last week's end the average was 102.81 points above its July 31 level.</br></br>There's no short, simple explanation of the linkage between the economy and stock market. But any serious effort to appraise one's prospects entails close attention to the other. An obvious tie involves profits. If it becomes clear that a company's profits are on the rise, demand for its shares is likely to increase, tending to push up their price. A subtler connection involves interest rates. Securities that offer fixed rates of interest compete for investors' dollars with common stocks, which offer dividends that may rise or fall according to changes in profitability. When interest rates fall, this renders interest-paying securities relatively less attractive. It's no coincidence that in general before the recent market surge profits were sharply on the rise and interest rates on the decline.</br></br>In all, a wide variety of factors can play upon the market. Among them are shifts in investor confidence, concern about rising or falling prices, worry over higher taxes or stiffer governmental regulations, changes in so-called margin requirements that limit what investors may borrow to buy stocks, the flow of money from overseas, major strikes and the failure of a large corporation. But business-cycle history leaves little doubt that the fundamental influence is the broad economic trend.</br></br>The 0.9% drop in the Commerce Department's leading-indicator index in June has been widely interpreted as a signal that the economy, at the least, will grow at a slower pace in coming months. This, in turn, has been seen as a good reason to invest in common stocks, since a slower-paced expansion would presumably last longer and be accompanied by somewhat lower interest rates.</br></br>The record shows, however, that a decline of only a month or two in the leading-indicator index by no means guarantees an economic slowing. In fact, the June drop was the first monthly decline since August 1982. Moreover, it's possible that subsequent revisions in the various components of the Commerce index may eventually turn the decline into an increase. Several times since August 1982 reported monthly declines in the index have indeed been revised into gains.",,,

Raising prices has always been an art form, but these days it is approaching the status of a lost art form. Yes, there are the usual suspects that can achieve ""pricing power"" in good times and bad. They tend to be the rare ""service"" providers without global competition: universities that raise tuition; hospitals jacking up fees; or near monopolies such as cable-television operators. Indeed, cable-TV giant Comcast Corp. has raised prices steadily all through the economic downturn, and in some markets, Comcast prices are up 15% since mid-2000.</br></br>But for every business operating in a Comcast-type world these days, many more operate in what might be called a Wal-Mart world of flat or falling prices. Wal-Mart is famous for extracting ever-lower prices from its global army of suppliers. In turn, this forces suppliers to stay profitable by means of productivity gains instead of price increases. It's a powerful force that James Smith, an economist at the University of North Carolina, dubs ""the Wal-Martization of the U.S. economy.""</br></br>Thus, as the economy gathers strength, there's a big question looming.

842613609,7,11/20/14,"Raise Interest Rates, Make Grandma Smile","For America's 44 million senior citizens, plus tens of millions of others who are on the threshold of retirement, last month marked a watershed moment that is worth celebrating. At the end of October, the Federal Reserve announced the first step in returning to a more normal monetary policy. After nearly six years of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing, the Fed is ending its bond-buying program and has signaled a plan to eventually begin raising the federal-funds rate, raising interest rates to more normal levels by 2017.</br></br>U.S. households lost billions in interest income during the Fed's near-zero interest rate experiment. Because they are often reliant on income from savings, seniors were hit the hardest. Households headed by seniors 65-74 years old lost on average $1,900 in annual income over the past six years, according to a November 2013 McKinsey Global Institute report. For households headed by seniors 75 and older, the loss was $2,700 annually.</br></br>With a median income for senior households in the U.S. of roughly $25,000, these are significant losses. In total, according to my company's calculations, approximately $58 billion in annual income has been lost by America's seniors since 2008.</br></br>Retirees depend on income from their savings for basic living expenses. Without that income, many seniors have taken on greater risk to increase the potential yield on their savings, or simply spent down their nest eggs. After decades of playing by the rules, putting off spending and socking away money, seniors have taken it on the chin. This strikes a blow at the core American principles of self-reliance, individual responsibility and fairness.</br></br>Their lost income affects all Americans. Seniors make up 13% of the U.S. population and spend about $1.2 trillion annually -- a big chunk of America's $11.5 trillion consumer economy. In general, seniors spend more than their income, withdrawing each year from accumulated savings, and so their interest earnings get spent right back into the economy.",,,

Hourly earnings jumped 0.5% in March and are running at a 4% annual rate of increase for the first three months of the year.</br></br>It's a fluke, say Federal Reserve officials, who believe that the economy is too soft to support a round of big price increases. But that view may be rattled tomorrow and Friday, when the Labor Department releases new data on movement on the producer price and consumer price indexes in March. If the numbers show another solid increase in prices, it could incite much more serious worries about inflation.</br></br>Low inflation has been one of the bittersweet benefits of this unusually sluggish recovery. Demand hasn't been strong enough to allow retailers and producers to up the prices of goods. And a weak labor market has kept wages relatively subdued. As a result, consumer prices edged up their smallest amount in six years during 1992.</br></br>But now that the economy is showing signs of firming, some businesses are trying to push through price increases, hoping the market will finally bear it.

In May of last year, Mr. Hall and his colleagues believed the latest recession might be over. Consumers were spending more and economic output was rising. All that the committee members needed to see was a few months of uninterrupted job growth to announce the end of the recession. ""It seemed like the timing was imminent,"" he says.</br></br>But Mr. Hall is still waiting.

The employment rate matters too, and it's still looking anemic.","The Federal Reserve's Sept. 18 decision to stay the course on its asset purchases surprised and confused many market participants, who felt the central bank had sent contradictory signals about its intentions. In fact, the Fed has behaved in a way completely consistent with Chairman Ben Bernanke's public comments, at least since July. A careful look at the labor market numbers suggests that if the Fed sticks to the chairman's words, there will be no significant tapering any time soon.</br></br>Before July, the Fed announced on a number of occasions that a 6.5% unemployment rate would indicate that it is time to start raising interest rates and winding down its easy-money policies. The unemployment rate has fallen significantly from its high of 10% in October 2009 to the mid-sevens. But the labor market is still sickly because, as I pointed out in these pages in June, the employment rate--the proportion of the working-age population that has jobs--has made little progress.</br></br>The employment rate is the best single indicator of labor-market health, and it is still hovering at around 58.5%, down significantly from its pre-recession levels of over 63%. The economy is adding jobs, but just barely staying ahead of population growth. Rather than making up for ground lost during the recession, the economy is still treading water.</br></br>Mr. Bernanke and other Fed governors are clearly aware of the distinction between the unemployment and employment rates. In his July 17 congressional testimony, Mr. Bernanke said that ""if a substantial part of the reductions in measured unemployment were judged to reflect cyclical declines in labor force participation rather than gains in employment (my emphasis), the [Federal Open Market] Committee would be unlikely to view a decline in unemployment to 6.5% as a sufficient reason to raise its target for the federal funds rate."" The jobs report for August showed the decline in labor-force participation and employment rates that the Fed feared.</br></br>On Sept. 18--following the FOMC's vote to continue its current pace of bond-buying--Mr. Bernanke reinforced the message. ""The unemployment rate is not necessarily a great measure in all circumstances of the state of the labor market overall,"" he said.

Hiring grew at a healthy pace in professional services, leisure and hospitality, while falling slightly in construction and manufacturing.</br></br>Yet even as payrolls are rising, albeit slowly, the overall labor participation rate has continued to fall.

In the last year alone, the number of working age nonworkers grew to 89.2 million from 86.8 million.</br></br>So why are more Americans sitting on the labor market sidelines even as job opportunities expand?

Many institutions are restricted by their own rules in the amount of debt they can own in the B-rated category, where New York City had been.</br></br>Moody's action, which applied to the city's general-obligation bond, was the first upgrade for such bonds since 1988, during former Mayor Edward Koch's administration and just before the city entered a deep recession. In fact, less than three years ago Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, the other big ratings house, downgraded city bonds to BBB-plus from A-minus.</br></br>Market analysts said that city debt prices were largely unchanged by the news, but could improve in the days and weeks to come as more investors decide to buy New York debt again. Like Moody's, Standard & Poor's is seeing the city in a different light, and officials there said they are considering an upgrade of city bonds after New York releases its new budget.</br></br>Can investors sleep tight knowing the rating agencies are keeping close tabs on the city's fiscal health? If you own city debt, you may want to study up on the last time bond raters said the city's finances were improving. In November 1987, Standard & Poor's upgraded city bonds just weeks after the stock market's crash; the market's tailspin caused massive layoffs on Wall Street, a citywide recession and, eventually, lower bond prices.

The Federal Reserve disclosed that its policy makers lowered their forecast for economic growth this year to between 1.3% and 2%, half a percentage point below the level of their previous forecast, in October.

But shares rallied after the afternoon release of the minutes of the Jan. 29-30 meeting of Fed policy makers and their latest forecast for the economy.

842614125,7,10/10/88,Has the Bull Just Been Sleeping?,"Most commentators have concluded that stock prices were so high in August that they inevitably brought about a crash that ended the bull market. The price-earnings ratio was 22.1, certainly high. But compare prices at the end of other bull markets: for instance, in 1961 the Dow Jones P-E reached 24.2. The Dow then climbed another 32% in the next four years after a falloff of its own in 1962.</br></br>And looking at the Dow Jones does not tell the whole story. In August 1987 it happened that many of the Dow stocks were those with the highest P-Es. But this has not always been the case in the past. In 1969 when the Dow had a P-E of 17, IBM (not then in the Dow) was 42 times earnings, Xerox was at 48 times, Avon 57 times, and Polaroid was actually at 71 times its earnings. Did August even begin to compare?</br></br>Another important method of telling whether the stock market is overpriced is to compare the total value of stocks with the nominal gross national product. At the August peak the value of stocks was 95% of GNP. This is high, but at the 1929 market peak it was 170% of GNP. For the market to have been that high in August, the Dow would have been at 4,627.</br></br>Another method of determining how high prices are is to take a previous high and adjust it for inflation. In 1966 the Dow hit an intra-day high of 1,001. Adjusting that figure for inflation today gives approximately 3,540, or a full 30% above the August peak.</br></br>Thus three significant stock-price indicators show that prices were not so high in August that the bull market had to come to an end. But the reasons to doubt the current bear-market consensus go beyond that line of analysis.",,,

842614300,5,8/16/12,What's Really in the Ryan Budget,"Thanks to several years of fiscal restraint during the 1990s, the burden of federal spending dropped to 18.2% of gross domestic product by the time Bill Clinton left office. The federal budget today consumes more than 24% of economic output, a one-third increase since 2001 in the share of the U.S. economy allocated by politics rather than market forces. That makes the Republican House budget, which would reverse this trend, extremely important for the economic health of the country.</br></br>Both political parties deserve blame for the spending spree that's put America in a fiscal ditch. President George W. Bush was a big spender and President Obama has compounded the damage with his stimulus spending and other programs.</br></br>But the era of bipartisan big government may have come to an end. Largely thanks to Rep. Paul Ryan and the fiscal blueprint he prepared as chairman of the House Budget Committee earlier this year, the GOP has begun climbing back on the wagon of fiscal sobriety and has shown at least some willingness to restrain the growth of government.</br></br>The Ryan budget has generated considerable controversy in Washington, and it will become even more of an issue now that Mr. Ryan is Mitt Romney's running mate. So it's an appropriate time to analyze the plan and consider what it would mean for America.</br></br>The most important headline about the Ryan budget is that it limits the growth rate of federal spending, with outlays increasing by an average of 3.1% annually over the next 10 years. If spending is left on autopilot, by contrast, it would grow by 4.3% (or nearly 39% faster). If President Obama is re-elected, the burden of spending presumably will climb more rapidly.",,,

He also would raise taxes on gasoline, beer, wine, cigarettes and industrial pollutants, and would cut military spending by 3% from current levels. The goal of his five-year, $511.6 billion plan is to eliminate the projected budget deficit by the end of fiscal 1994 and create surpluses each year thereafter.</br></br>But the Rostenkowski plan, or even anything close to it, isn't likely to be enacted this year as long as President Bush opposes major tax increases and cuts in Social Security.

But by yesterday, the focus had changed dramatically. After Monday's unprecedented market crash, traders and analysts were calling on the central bank to ease credit to avoid recession.</br></br>""I think Greenspan is the only candidate for restoring the confidence of the markets,"" said Jerry Jordan, the chief economist at First Interstate Bank Corp. ""It's the chairman of the Fed, when it comes down to it, who pulls the levers.""</br></br>Whether Mr. Greenspan is up to that task remains to be seen. He tried to calm markets yesterday with a one-sentence statement signaling the Fed's switch from an anti-inflation to an anti-recession policy. It said: ""The Federal Reserve, consistent with its responsibilities as the nation's central bank, affirmed today its readiness to serve as a source of liquidity to support the economic and financial system.""</br></br>The Federal Reserve quickly backed up its statement with action, driving the federal funds rate down to about 6 3/4% late in the day from more than 7 1/2% Monday. ""I think that speaks for itself,"" said a senior administration official when asked if the Fed had eased credit. The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge on loans to each other, is a sensitive measure of the tightness of monetary policy.",,

""We haven't created the pent-up demand,"" necessary for a sales boom, she added.</br></br>The Big Three's cautious year-end production plans sharply contrast with the aggressive production schedules they set and mostly kept earlier this year, despite criticism by analysts that those schedules were unwarranted. Meanwhile, foreign-based U.S. auto makers are continuing their trend of boosting car production.</br></br>The U.S. operations of Japanese auto makers continue to account for a growing portion of U.S. car production. Plants owned by foreign auto makers or operated as joint ventures with U.S. companies plan to build 312,609 cars in the fourth quarter, or 18.3% of the total, up from 205,875 cars, or 10.9% of the total a year ago.</br></br>Overbuilding earlier in the year caused auto makers to trim their bulging inventories of vehicles by sponsoring aggressive sales promotions, including cash rebates to consumers. That helped reduce inventories but, analysts say, it also prompted consumers who were considering purchasing later in the year to do so before then. The effect will be fewer car and truck sales in the coming months. Consumers also will be slow to purchase the 1990 models because some of the models carry the sharpest price rises in recent years.",,,

842614471,6,6/1/92,The Outlook: Capital Spending Will Boost Recovery,"NEW YORK -- This is a recovery that may need all the help it can muster. The economy as a whole has been expanding for a year, but mostly at a snail's pace and far more slowly than is normal in the early stages of a business-cycle upswing. The unemployment rate hangs stubbornly above 7%, higher than when the recovery began. And new-home starts, a rare bright spot during most of 1991 and early this year, fell sharply in April.</br></br>Help is clearly needed, but is any on the way? Perhaps. A likely source, as important as it is unexciting: capital spending.</br></br>Such outlays, typically for new plant and equipment, tend to lag behind the economy as a whole. The Commerce Department, in fact, classifies plant-and-equipment spending, adjusted for inflation, as a lagging economic indicator at points in the business cycle when, as now, the economy is emerging from a slump. Such spending invariably fell, for example, in the early months of four other recoveries since 1969.</br></br>This pattern has occurred again in the current recovery. In last year's second quarter, as the recovery was just beginning to take hold, plant-and-equipment spending fell to an annual rate of some $487 billion, in terms of the 1987 dollar's buying power; this was $9 billion less than in the previous quarter. But more recently an impressive climb has taken place: The spending level recently moved above $525 billion.</br></br>Further substantial increases seem probable. Most forecasters look for the recovery to persist and broaden in coming months. In the process, businesses will need to expand their facilities appreciably. Indeed, the task could become urgent if the recovery should prove unexpectedly brisk. After much restructuring and many plant closings, manufacturers already are using nearly 80% of their capacity.",,,

That's due in part to a robust November that lured shoppers with discounts galore as well as the retailers' ability to keep inventories and expenses in line after having tough lessons learned during the recession.</br></br>That's the good news. With mounting prices on everything from fuel and food to cotton, retailers still are expected to offer muted full-year earnings guidance for 2011.

Although they recognize that tax increases hurt the economy, they argue that our huge deficit requires Congress to raise revenue through a tax hike.</br></br>This argument rests on the flawed premise that we can reduce the deficit only by increasing taxes, as if high levels of spending are a given. Not so.</br></br>To reduce spending and reignite growth, this Congress or its successor should take two actions. First, immediately cut the level of spending that has been increased so dramatically since 2008. Second, institute an ""inflation-minus-one"" rule to constrain future spending increases.</br></br>Much public discussion focuses on the deficit, which is indeed at critical levels of around 10% of GDP. But even if President Obama succeeds at lowering the deficit to 4% of GDP by 2013, our public-debt-to-GDP ratio will still be dangerously high, at over 70%, or nearly twice what it was during the Bush years.

842614578,3,6/23/97,Manager's journal: America's corporations should swear off pork,"Earlier this month an ad appeared in this newspaper entitled ""Declaration of Independence: End Corporate Welfare."" It was signed by 61 top Silicon Valley executives, including me. In calling for government to end corporate pork-barrel politics, we were taking a moral stand.</br></br>The first Americans hated taxes; the Constitution limited government and, originally, banned levies on personal income. For the first two centuries of our nation, the common man became better off more quickly than any other time in history. Per capita U.S. gross domestic product grew to $28,540 in 1996 from just $919 (in 1996 dollars) in 1776. Mankind took 30,000 years to get to $919, but only 220 more years to reach $28,540. But today the American Dream is being eroded. Since 1976 annual GDP growth per capita (expressed as a 20-year rolling average) has steadily declined, to 1.5% from 2.5%. Why? In part because federal, state and local taxes now consume a whopping 35% of our national output. Current peacetime spending is higher than the 29% peak during World War I; the all-time record was 49% during World War II.</br></br>American companies should lead in the reduction of destructive government spending. Eliminating corporate welfare is a moral imperative: We should not be asking senior citizens and the poor to tighten their belts while our government is, actually subsidizes the sale of American chardonnay to the French.</br></br>Taxing and spending to support U.S. industry creates a vicious circle. With corporate taxes high, companies lobby for give-backs to remain competitive. Congress faces extreme pressure to ""bring home the pork"" to home-state corporations. That requires even higher taxes -- and the circle continues.</br></br>Corporate subsidies are often known by euphemisms such as ""government investments"" or ""government-industry partnerships."" Such Washington-speak notwithstanding, Americans are compelled to pay for silly programs like the proposal by the Commerce Department's Advanced Technology Program to genetically re-engineer cotton, making its fibers more like polyester.

842614587,6,8/7/13,Behind the Middle-Class Funk,"President Obama is working hard to refocus attention on the middle class, and rightly so. While a decent society will provide opportunity and, when necessary, direct assistance to the poor, the long-term health of our economy and our democracy depends on a prosperous, self-confident middle class.</br></br>That's not what we've had in recent years. Median incomes fell sharply during the Great Recession and have barely begun to recover. Despite recent signs of recovery, housing -- the principal source of wealth for middle-class households -- remains priced about 25% below its pre-recession peak. Many workers who lost middle-income jobs have found only part-time or low-wage replacements and doubt that they will ever regain their pre-recession standard of living. Not surprisingly, many middle-class parents now doubt that their children will enjoy comparable lives</br></br>Concern about the middle class is not new. Compared with the quarter-century after World War II, recent decades -- though not disastrous -- were disappointing, even before the Great Recession. Many economists define the middle class as those adults whose annual household income is between two-thirds and twice the national median -- today, that means roughly $40,000 to $120,000. By this standard, according to the Pew Research Center, the middle class is significantly smaller than it once was. In 1971, it accounted for fully 61% of adults, compared with 14% for the upper class and 25% for the lower class.</br></br>Four decades later, the middle class share had declined by 10 percentage points to just 51%, while the upper class share increased by six points and the lower class by four. The U.S. income distribution is still a bell curve, but the left and right tails are fatter and the hump in the middle is lower.</br></br>This means that the middle class is less economically and socially dominant than it once was. Relatively speaking, more Americans are enjoying affluent lives at the same time that more are just barely making it (if at all). But that doesn't mean the middle class got poorer. During those 40 years, Pew calculates, the median income of middle-class households (adjusted for inflation) grew by 34%. The median grew for the others as well -- by 43% for upper-income households and 29% for those with incomes below the middle class. This isn't surprising, because the median income for all U.S. households rose by 32% during that period, from $44,845 in 1970 to $59,127 in 2010. Indeed, 86% of middle-class Americans, and 84% of all Americans, enjoy higher incomes than their parents did.",,,

Indeed, these declines shaved 0.7 percentage point on average from gross domestic product growth in the first two quarters of 2011. Typically, that would be no disaster. Trouble is, this recovery has been unusually weak. So the government cutbacks effectively halved real GDP growth in the first half of 2011, leaving it at just 0.8% annualized.</br></br>The pace of underlying growth is expected to pick up a bit in coming months.

A more useful place to look for guidance on regulation of the financial system is Daniel Tarullo, a Federal Reserve Board governor and its point man for banking reform. Mr. Tarullo gave a speech in Chicago on May 8 that was as unsettling as it was, by the Fed's inscrutable standards, unguarded.</br></br>Addressing the Chicago Fed Bank Structure Conference, Mr. Tarullo proposed that the central bank must ""broaden the perimeter of prudential regulation, both to certain nonbank financial institutions and to certain activities by all financial actors."" This expansion of regulatory authority would take the Fed far beyond the current power it exercises thanks to the Dodd-Frank law passed in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crises. The casualties of such an expansion could include small- and medium-size banks.</br></br>Under Dodd-Frank, ultimate financial regulatory power resides with the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or FSOC, a council of 10 regulators chaired by the Treasury and which includes the Fed chairman. The FSOC can designate asset managers, mutual funds, hedge funds, or even broker-dealers as systemically important financial institutions, or SIFIs, a classification that puts an institution under the Fed's regulatory authority. The council has already designated the large insurers AIG and Prudential as SIFIs, and it has many more nonbank financial companies in its sights.</br></br>The council's moves are part of a larger blueprint that Mr. Tarullo has now laid out. In the Chicago speech, he proposed ditching complex Basel III capital and liquidity regulations and reducing regulations on small banks. The new system he outlined would use simpler, Basel I capital charges for small banks, on grounds that the failure of these banks would pose no threat to financial stability. Larger regional banks would require slightly elevated regulatory standards, but nothing too complex.</br></br>Once a bank joins a ""club"" of the 80 largest institutions, however, the Federal Reserve should be its regulator, Mr. Tarullo said, and regulation should focus on annual stress tests. The very largest institutions, U.S. global banks and nonbank SIFIs, would receive the most intrusive Fed oversight and be required to satisfy the full range of new international macroprudential rules.",,

842614708,4,8/9/10,Fairness and the Capital Tax Fetish,"Friday's weak employment report reminds us anew of the flagging U.S. economic recovery. While the Obama administration discusses additional stimulus packages, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is arguing that we should roll back key elements of the Bush tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. The administration is particularly skeptical about the benefits of today's lower rates on dividends and capital gains.</br></br>The tax on dividends, for example, is currently 15%, but it could increase to as high as 39.6% if the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts expire. On top of this, a new 3.8% tax on investment incomes for high-income earners begins in 2013 to help pay for ObamaCare. The administration's arguments for higher taxes on capital center on fairness and the need for deficit reduction.</br></br>These arguments are seriously mistaken. The relationship between investment, capital and wages is such that workers are better off if capital is not taxed at all.</br></br>Think of the economy as a pie split among workers, savers and the government, with the government's slice fixed. The savers' slice will equal the after-tax return on each unit of the capital stock, and what's left goes to workers as after-tax wages. The fairness advocates in effect claim that low tax rates on dividends and capital gains increase the share of the pie that goes to high-income savers. But the low tax rates increase the absolute size of the workers' slice by making the entire pie bigger. That's because low tax rates encourage capital accumulation, productivity and wage growth.</br></br>To understand how this works, it's worthwhile to return to President Bush's proposal, in January 2003, to substantially reduce the double taxation of corporate income by eliminating investor-level taxes on dividends. (The actual law reduced tax rates on dividends and capital gains to 15%.)",,,

Sales of fall and back-to-school goods were almost uniformly ""disappointing or below expectations,"" the Fed said.</br></br>Manufacturing picked up in some districts, however. The Philadelphia Fed, for example, found strong demand for electrical machinery, metals and glass products. ""It's not a boom, mind you,"" a steel production representative cautioned the Chicago Fed. Indeed, purchase orders mostly softened in the Dallas and Cleveland districts.</br></br>In keeping with what analysts call a slow but steadily growing economy, construction improved slightly, and there was a ""firming"" in commercial and industrial leasing activity. Also, inflation remains under control. Wage gains were moderate, despite mostly tight labor markets, and reports of rapidly rising materials costs fell off substantially, the report said.</br></br>But the reluctance of consumers to spend is keeping the slow-rolling economy from shedding its training wheels. In the Boston district, where sales in September and October fell by as much as 20% from the year-earlier period, widespread discounting is ""eating away at gross margins and profits,"" the Boston Fed said.

842614750,4,6/17/10,U.S. Debt and the Greece Analogy,,"Author: Alan Greenspan</br></br>An urgency to rein in budget deficits seems to be gaining some traction among American lawmakers. If so, it is none too soon. Perceptions of a large U.S. borrowing capacity are misleading.</br></br>Despite the surge in federal debt to the public during the past 18 months--to $8.6 trillion from $5.5 trillion--inflation and long-term interest rates, the typical symptoms of fiscal excess, have remained remarkably subdued. This is regrettable, because it is fostering a sense of complacency that can have dire consequences.</br></br>The roots of the apparent debt market calm are clear enough. The financial crisis, triggered by the unexpected default of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, created a collapse in global demand that engendered a high degree of deflationary slack in our economy. The very large contraction of private financing demand freed private saving to finance the explosion of federal debt. Although our financial institutions have recovered perceptibly and returned to a degree of solvency, banks, pending a significant increase in capital, remain reluctant to lend.</br></br>Beneath the calm, there are market signals that do not bode well for the future. For generations there had been a large buffer between the borrowing capacity of the U.S. government and the level of its debt to the public. But in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, that gap began to narrow rapidly. Federal debt to the public rose to 59% of GDP by mid-June 2010 from 38% in September 2008. How much borrowing leeway at current interest rates remains for U.S. Treasury financing is highly uncertain.",,

Republicans are eyeing cheaper options, such as only doubling the cap and letting it to expire after a few years.</br></br>The changes are necessary if the Senate is to stay within its budget limit of a $350 billion, 10-year tax-cut package. If tax writers can find ways to offset extra costs, the final figure could grow to $400 billion.</br></br>Despite the $350 billion lid -- set by Republican moderates who worry about the ballooning federal deficit -- Mr. Bush wants Congress to approve the dividend-tax repeal that is the centerpiece of his economic-growth plan.

842614834,4,3/14/84,Reigning Wisdom's Shaky Economic Ground,"Many economists and economic scribes have arrived at a particular gloomy paradigm to describe the current U.S. economy. This consensus is surprising because the paradigm itself is seriously flawed.</br></br>The paradigm consists of four propositions: First, government deficits are responsible for high interest rates; second, high interest rates are responsible for the ""overvalued"" dollar; third, the overvalued dollar is responsible for the huge increase in the U.S. trade deficit; and, finally, the trade deficit is just plain bad.</br></br>The validity of the propositions is limited and decreases rapidly as one moves down the list.</br></br>Consider the first proposition. As Treasury Secretary Donald Regan keeps reminding us, empirical analysis shows no statistically significant historical relationship between budget deficits and interest rates. Over the past three years, while the deficit has more than tripled, the prime rate -- the base interest rate that commercial banks charge on loans to their biggest borrowers with the best credit ratings -- has fallen to 11% from 18.9%. Adjusting interest rates for inflation to approximate the ""real"" rate of interest doesn't change the picture very much: During the same period the real rate fell to 7% from 10%, notwithstanding the tripled deficit.</br></br>Nevertheless, there is common-sense validity to the notion that larger government borrowing will, other things being equal, exert upward pressure on rates. (However, one point that's usually neglected by those who advance this argument is that efforts to reduce the deficit by increasing taxes may also exert upward pressure on interest rates because increased taxes will result in decreased private savings, rather than simply in reduced private spending.)",,,

The ""twin deficits"" are turning America into a banana republic. The weight of debt threatens turmoil in the Third World. Only urgent action will save the day: The dollar must fall and taxes must rise.</br></br>Sound familiar? It should, because such dread and dismay have been the conventional economic wisdom, at least among political and media elites, on the eve of every economic summit in the 1980s. Just a year or even six months ago, the apocalyptics were still in full cry. So as the decade's last economic summit unfolds in Paris after yet another year of growth, it's as good a time as any to examine how wrong the fear and loathing has been.</br></br>My favorite doomsayer is Stephen Marris of the Institute for International Economics, a frequently quoted outfit that has served as an inverse indicator during the 1980s; whatever it says will happen almost certainly won't. Last May, Mr. Marris told the Business Council that, ""If the next president of the United States . . . does not act immediately and decisively to cut the budget deficit, he is going to preside over the decline and fall of this great nation.""</br></br>Mr. Marris was building on his earlier insight, offered in 1984, that ""time is running out."" If $150 billion wasn't cut from the U.S. budget deficit by 1987, he wrote, ""the present recovery in both the United States and the rest of the world will come to an untimely end."" Alas the recovery, like the nation, keeps rolling along.</br></br>It's unfair to single out Mr. Marris, so let's widen the memory net. Fred Bergsten, his partner in prophecy at IIE, wrote last November that, ""there is still time to avert disaster,"" if only then President-elect Bush would raise taxes and devalue the dollar. He wrote the same thing in 1984, too, and in 1985, and . . .",,,

What's more, they appear to be getting ready for this.</br></br>The unemployment rate has been falling swiftly, dropping to 6.3% in May from 7.5% a year earlier. But there's an open question about how much slack there is in the job market. Some 37.2% of the working-age population is out of the labor force now, compared with 34% when the recession started in 2007. And while some of those people lost to the labor pool will likely return, some, such as those nearing retirement age and those whose skills have eroded, may never come back.</br></br>At Wednesday's news conference following the Federal Reserve's two-day policy meeting this week, Chairwoman Janet Yellen indicated that for her, an important sign the labor market is tightening will be when wages are increasing more rapidly.

Last June, they had expected year-ahead gains of 2.5%.

842614898,5,5/13/13,Beware Bond-Market Mood Swings,"From hero to zero in just 10 days: May's selloff has seen year-to-date gains for holders of U.S. Treasurys, German bunds and U.K. gilts wiped out and turned to losses. Some are asking if this is a definitive turning point for the bond market after its 30-year bull run. It isn't clear yet that global yields have hit bottom--but it is clear that bonds are becoming hypersensitive to the smallest twists and turns in the economy.</br></br>The turn in mood has been sharp. On May 2, after the European Central Bank cut rates and hinted that it might yet push the rate on its deposit facility into negative territory, 10-year German yields hit a record low around 1.15%; U.S. yields were at a low for the year of 1.63%. But since then, a better-than-expected U.S. jobs report, some encouraging German industrial data and a brewing debate about how and when the U.S. Federal Reserve might wind down its bond-purchase program have pushed yields sharply higher, to 1.36% in Germany and 1.92% in the U.S. Gilt yields have broadly tracked Treasurys.</br></br>But none of the data yet suggest an economy that is standing on firm ground: U.S. payrolls growth of 165,000 in April was better than expected, but hardly stellar, albeit prior months were also revised upward. Better data for Germany is welcome, but is unlikely to pull the euro zone as a whole out of its extended slump. Other indicators continue to suggest a soft patch. Most significantly, key measures of inflation have been falling, which should be bond-friendly: In the U.S., the core Personal Consumption Expenditure measure, the Fed's favored inflation gauge, has dropped to 1.1%, while euro-zone inflation is estimated at 1.2% in April, down from 1.7% in March. And since the start of May, the ECB, the Danish central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, the Reserve Bank of India, the National Bank of Poland and the Bank of Korea have all cut rates--between them accounting for some 23% of world GDP, notes Deutsche Bank.</br></br>Further falls in inflation may yet scotch talk of tapering bond purchases in the U.S. In the euro zone, the ECB may yet become more dovish. And the full effects of the Bank of Japan's new activism have yet to be seen--although Japanese net purchases of foreign bonds have now turned positive, another potential support for U.S. and European markets.</br></br>Still, the violence of May's selloff suggests that with yields at such low levels, investors are very sensitive to any data that goes against expectations and are very quick to try to judge what that means for central-bank policy. That means more volatility lies ahead. Investors should watch out.",,,

The higher deficit may not matter much in the long run but in the short-term it forces U.S. companies to make costly production adjustments. Firms that manufacture widgets, both for export and to compete against foreign-made widgets in the U.S., will find themselves temporarily overstocked and will have to decrease production accordingly.</br></br>The trade deficit is likely to keep growing. If experience is any guide, many Asian businesses will do anything to keep their plants open, including dumping goods by selling at below market price in any market that can absorb them. Perhaps the only reason we haven't seen this dumping yet is that, because the Asian crises originated in their financial markets, export financing has been hard to come by.</br></br>International trade has boosted the U.S. economy for years, but now it is an economic drag and will remain so for some time to come. As Asian economies falter, foreign demand for U.S. goods and services falls. And as imports rise, U.S. companies find the competition tougher at home.",,,

Isn't it a little early to start criticizing a plan that is still being developed?</br></br>Though we are encouraged by some recent signs of a rebound, the economy is recovering at half the rate of past recessions. A carefully crafted consumer, investor and business tax package would provide the synergies needed to push the economy into high gear and help ensure durable economic growth. In a recent letter to the president, we suggested cutting consumer taxes, allowing larger depreciation write-offs and reducing the double taxation of dividends.</br></br>Our studies show that allowing companies to deduct 50% of corporate dividends would add one-half a percentage point to average GDP growth through 2005. Similarly, our study shows that this change would accelerate productivity growth to 2.4% over the next three years, compared with 2% without this change. A phased reduction of the double tax on corporate dividends would encourage firms to rely more on equity financing, leading to higher investment spending and a larger capital stock.</br></br>One of the most effective ways to spur business investment and continued technological advances that promote productivity growth is through an enhanced capital-cost recovery system. Finally, accelerating the tax cuts enacted in June 2001 will help ensure that consumer confidence and spending remain strong. Because many small businesses pay taxes at the individual rate, they also will benefit from accelerated rate cuts.</br></br>Jerry Jasinowski",,,

The Commerce Department said the upward revision mostly was due to a larger-than-expected rise in inventories during June.</br></br>The revised second-quarter productivity gain is based on a 2.2% increase in non-farm output and a 1.2% increase in hours worked. The earlier estimate was based on a 1.9% increase in output and a 1.4% increase in hours. All the figures represent seasonally adjusted annual rates.</br></br>The latest productivity figures continue a pattern of peaks and valleys that characterize economic growth in the later stages of an economic cycle. Productivity generally rises sharply in the early stages of a business recovery and then tapers off as employers hire more workers.

As economist Larry Kudlow points out, we are now officially in a private-sector recession (two straight quarters of no growth in the economy outside of government). A weak economy in 2002 will mean major and potentially catastrophic GOP losses at the polls in the crucial midterm elections.</br></br>Yet ever since the passage of the president's tax cut back in June, the GOP's legislative momentum has slammed nose first into a concrete wall erected by Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt. Virtually every bill that now is speeding through Congress is a growth depressant. The legislative docket is filled with financially bearish legislation -- to wit, the patients' bill of rights (which will cause a rash of lawsuits and enrich the trial lawyers); the Medicare prescription drug benefit (which could cost taxpayers $300 billion over the next 10 years); the farm bill (which would give away record subsidies to the agri-business industry); and the appropriations bills (that could allow spending to grow by 8% or 9% this year). President Bush should announce that he will veto any or all of these until the economy recovers.</br></br>This is America's first New Economy recession. American investors, of all incomes, have lost an unprecedented $4 to $5 trillion in wealth in the past 18 months. There's no reassuring market signal that these losses will be recouped anytime soon and there's certainly little federal action to revive growth. These enormous wealth losses have not yet punctured consumer confidence or spending, and they have not caused many net job losses. Nor have real estate values taken a hit. Not yet, at least.</br></br>We are surfing uncharted waters. This recession is driven by a drought in investment, not a conventional drought in consumption. High risk capital investment funding -- one of the driving forces behind the powerful expansion of the mid- and late-1990s -- has dried up. Venture capital funding is down more than 50% so far this year and the IPO market is moribund.</br></br>Over the past several weeks, the White House proclamations on the economy by Larry Lindsey and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill have been mostly happy talk about recovery by the end of the year. Let's hope they're right. But what if they're not? Where is the economic and political contingency plan? A pep talk is not enough to rescue the economy from its doldrums. True, many Wall Street economists are also predicting a resumption of growth soon, but they have been totally wrong in predicting the direction of the economy and stock market over the past several years, so their confidence is actually discouraging.",,,
842615131,6,11/26/10,There's No Escaping Hauser's Law,"Even amoebas learn by trial and error, but some economists and politicians do not. The Obama administration's budget projections claim that raising taxes on the top 2% of taxpayers, those individuals earning more than $200,000 and couples earning $250,000 or more, will increase revenues to the U.S. Treasury. The empirical evidence suggests otherwise. None of the personal income tax or capital gains tax increases enacted in the post-World War II period has raised the projected tax revenues.</br></br>Over the past six decades, tax revenues as a percentage of GDP have averaged just under 19% regardless of the top marginal personal income tax rate. The top marginal rate has been as high as 92% (1952-53) and as low as 28% (1988-90). This observation was first reported in an op-ed I wrote for this newspaper in March 1993. A wit later dubbed this ""Hauser's Law.""</br></br>Over this period there have been more than 30 major changes in the tax code including personal income tax rates, corporate tax rates, capital gains taxes, dividend taxes, investment tax credits, depreciation schedules, Social Security taxes, and the number of tax brackets among others. Yet during this period, federal government tax collections as a share of GDP have moved within a narrow band of just under 19% of GDP.</br></br>Why? Higher taxes discourage the ""animal spirits"" of entrepreneurship. When tax rates are raised, taxpayers are encouraged to shift, hide and underreport income. Taxpayers divert their effort from pro-growth productive investments to seeking tax shelters, tax havens and tax exempt investments. This behavior tends to dampen economic growth and job creation. Lower taxes increase the incentives to work, produce, save and invest, thereby encouraging capital formation and jobs. Taxpayers have less incentive to shelter and shift income.</br></br>On average, GDP has grown at a faster pace in the several quarters after taxes are lowered than the several quarters before the tax reductions. In the six quarters prior to the May 2003 Bush tax cuts, GDP grew at an average annual quarterly rate of 1.8%. In the six quarters following the tax cuts, GDP grew at an average annual quarterly rate of 3.8%. Yet taxes as a share of GDP have remained within a relatively narrow range as a percent of GDP in the entire post-World War II period.",,,

The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 6% from 5.8%. Most troublesome, the average workweek fell 0.3 hour, an indication that companies don't have enough work to occupy even those employees that remain after the latest cuts.

The rising unemployment rate, he said, ""should serve as a clear signal to the United States Congress we need a bold economic recovery package so people can find work.""</br></br>Since the jobs report shows no sign of the postwar pickup that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has been predicting, it will probably make some already-pessimistic Fed officials even more convinced an immediate cut in interest rates is needed. However, Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week that only ""limited"" information is available on the economy's performance since war uncertainty began to lift, though he already knew the job market had weakened further in April. That suggests he will counsel patience at tomorrow's central-banking meeting, rather than advocate cutting short-term rates from their current, 42-year low of 1.25%.",,,

The market, and through it the general economy, is being whipsawed by Congress's handling of the capital-gains issue. We first noted back on November 7 that Senator Mitchell was congratulating himself for killing the Bush capital-gains proposal, and wondered whether he'd take credit later if the economy stalled. On November 30, with the market at 2688 we wrote:</br></br>""The stock market, after rising while a capital-gains cut gained political momentum, collapsed 190 points when Mr. Mitchell stopped it, and now remains at about the August 1 level. Everyone is therefore looking for the Fed to ease monetary policy.""</br></br>The market rallied a bit in December; tax advisers suggested that normal year-end profit-taking be pushed into 1990, because their consensus among people who mattered -- George Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Dan Rostenkowski was that a capital-gains cut in 1990 was baked in the cake.",,,

842615249,3,12/30/10,Home Prices Are Still Too High,,"Author: Peter D. Schiff</br></br>Most economists concede that a lasting general recovery is unlikely without a recovery in the housing market. A marked increase in defaults and foreclosures from today's already elevated levels could produce losses that overwhelm banks and trigger another, deeper financial crisis. Study after study has shown that defaults go up when falling prices put mortgage holders ""underwater."" As a result, the trajectory of home prices has tremendous economic significance.</br></br>Earlier this year market observers breathed easier when national prices stabilized. But the ""robo-signing""-induced slowdown in the foreclosure market, the recent upward spike in home mortgage rates, and third quarter 2010 declines in the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home-price index--including very bad October numbers reported this week--have sparked concerns that a ""double dip"" in home prices is probable. A longer-term view of home price trends should sharply magnify this fear.</br></br>Even those economists worried about renewed price dips would be unlikely to believe that the vicious contractions of 2007 and 2008 (where prices fell about 30% nationally in just two years) could return. But they underestimate how distorted the market had become and how little it has since normalized.</br></br>By all accounts, the home price boom that began in January 1998, when the previous 1989 peak was finally surpassed, and topped out in June 2006 was extraordinary. The 173% gain in the Case-Shiller 10-City Index (the only monthly data metric that predates the year 2000) in those nine years averaged an eye-popping 19.2% per year.

The moves, analysts say, suggest banks still are scrambling for ways to finance investments in dollar-denominated securities such as U.S. mortgage-backed bonds.</br></br>Before the credit crisis hit in August 2007, foreign banks could freely borrow dollars from U.S. banks and one another.

842615335,4,12/12/07,Why Borrowers May Not Benefit From Rate Cut,,"Not all borrowers are benefiting from the Fed's moves to cut interest rates. The problem: Loans that are tied to a variety of interest-rate benchmarks -- some of which aren't necessarily moving in lockstep with Fed action.</br></br>Yesterday, the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.25% -- the central bank's third rate cut since mid-September -- to help ease the credit crunch and reduce the economy's chances of falling into a recession. The moves have helped some borrowers who have seen interest rates on their credit cards and home-equity lines of credit fall. Interest rates on many fixed-rate mortgages also have dropped amid a decline in Treasury yields as investors sought out safe investments.</br></br>But rates remain stubbornly high on other loans, including student debt and many adjustable-rate loans made to the same type of subprime borrowers whose troubles are now reverberating throughout the global financial system. These rates remain high because many of these loans are tied to the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, and not to more conventional interest-rate benchmarks such as Treasurys or banks' prime rate.</br></br>Libor, which is an interest rate banks charge on loans to each other, normally tracks the federal-funds rate closely. But continuing worries over the credit crisis have kept Libor unusually high -- partly because banks are reluctant to lend to one another -- even as other short-term interest rates have fallen in recent months. The U.S. dollar three-month Libor yesterday was 5.11%, down from 5.36% in late June. Over the same period, three-month Treasury bill yields have fallen much more steeply, to 2.95% from 4.8%. ""The Libor spread is screaming that there is a big, big stress point in the banking system,"" says James Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC, a market-research firm in Chicago.</br></br>Borrowers may need to read the fine print of their loan agreement or contact their lender to know what benchmark their loan is tied to. The biggest impact is likely to be felt among borrowers with ARMs that are about to reset. ""If you have a Libor-indexed ARM and you're facing a reset, that's going to be very disadvantageous because of the divergence between the Libor and Treasury yields,"" says Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst at Bankrate.com.",,

842615344,4,6/21/05,The 'Conundrum' Explained,"In recent months, one overriding debate has raged within the world- wide financial community. How can long-term U.S. interest rates be so low? And how can so many economists have been so wrong on their interest rate forecasts? No less a figure than Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, famously described this question as a ""conundrum"" in congressional testimony earlier this year.</br></br>It is stunning for the head of our central bank to describe himself as mystified by the behavior of overall rates. But he has plenty of company. This observer cannot recall a bigger disconnect between conventional wisdom and market reality on such a central issue. Indeed, today, yields on 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities have fallen to the astonishingly low levels of 4.1% and 4.4% respectively. Both are lower than the average annual yield for these securities over the last 25 years. These low rates persist even in the face of powerful factors which, in historical terms, should drive them up, including monetary policy itself, a strong U.S. economic growth outlook and the increasingly large size of our current account deficit. This contradiction is, in essence, the conundrum.</br></br>Three alternative schools of thought have emerged to explain it. One is that the bond market has overshot. A second is that the growth outlook is actually weaker than the consensus forecast, and the bond market is discounting such slower growth before it manifests itself. But the right answer involves excess global liquidity which, for the moment, has nowhere else to go but into dollar-denominated fixed- income assets like U.S. Treasury securities.</br></br>---</br></br>Before we proceed, let's review the conundrum itself in detail. Chairman Greenspan's precise comment referred to the unprecedented behavior of longer-term interest rates in light of recent monetary policy. He noted that the Federal Reserve Board has raised the Federal Funds Rate eight times since June, 2004. Mr. Greenspan emphasized that past increases in the shortest-term rates have always pushed up long- term rates. But not this time.",,,

The biggest threat to long-term economic growth is government growth of the magnitude that characterized the past two years and that is forecast for our future.</br></br>Our current problems are not a result of acts of nature. They stem from policy choices that dramatically increased the size of the government. In the past two years, the federal budget has grown by a whopping 16%. Importantly, growth in agency budgets other than Defense exceeded that in Defense, despite the surge in Afghanistan. The budget for Health and Human Services, for example, home to Medicare and Medicaid, rose a hefty 22%, as compared with 12% for Defense.</br></br>The sum of 11 other agencies, such as the Departments of Agriculture, Education and Labor, which combined account for more annual spending than Defense, experienced an increase of more than 50% over the two-year period.

Colin Powell's first term as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff expires in the autumn, and President Bush announced his reappointment a month ago. Mr. Greenspan's four-year term expires in a month, but Mr. Bush has made no announcement. Meanwhile, various aides, deputies and kibitzers tell reporters that the delay is an attempt to ""leverage"" the Fed to ease interest rates further.</br></br>This sounds all too much like the same advisers who urged Mr. Bush to raise taxes three months into this recession. Having abandoned their own control over fiscal policy, these advisers have since taken to lecturing Mr. Greenspan and the Fed on monetary policy. This is graceless at the least, but also probably dangerous; financial markets can see when stones are being thrown from glass houses in Washington.</br></br>Especially since Mr. Greenspan is the one U.S. official who has built some credibility in world markets lately. Amid the capital's fiscal gridlock, the Fed has had to steer the economy with its single monetary oar, and with fair results. The Fed has brought down long-term interest rates, which are the decisive rates for investment. It's done this without reigniting inflation, which except during Paul Volcker's Fed tenure, has been the expectation before every presidential election cycle.</br></br>It's true that, at 8.5% or so, long-term interest rates remain stubbornly high. But this isn't something the Fed can easily control. The Fed in the short run can dictate the fed-funds rate, which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans. And the Greenspan Fed has done this, dropping fed-funds to 5.75% April 30.",,,

Minster's employment of 680 is down 30% from 1981 pre-recession levels, Mr. Winch says, and unless orders improve quickly, ""we will be cutting back next year.""</br></br>Monarch, founded 75 years ago, and Minster, which began as a blacksmith shop in 1897, both are respected names in factory machinery. The tough going they're encountering after nearly three years of a U.S. economic recovery illustrates the predicament of many producers of factory machinery, construction equipment and other traditional capital goods.</br></br>Many makers of capital goods haven't fully recovered from a recession that extended from 1979 through 1983 for some equipment producers.

As in previous months, much of that increase stems from a sharp run-up in the cost of energy goods, which soared 7.5%, the biggest gain in almost a decade. Wholesale prices overall were 4% higher than they were in February 1999, the largest year-over-year change in more than 13 months.</br></br>On the other hand, the report offers some reason for optimism. Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.3% for the month, with a 6.3% surge in cigarette prices accounting for all of that increase. For the past 12 months, prices for core finished goods climbed just 1%, the lowest year-over-year change since last November.</br></br>Investors seemed undisturbed by yesterday's inflation report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 499.19 points -- a record rise when measured by points gained -- to close at 10630.60 as investors poured cash into blue-chip stocks. Bonds, which tend to fall in price on any sign of inflation, actually rose yesterday. The 10-year Treasury bond rose 10/32 point, about $3.125 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.

842615399,3,9/18/01,A Taxed Market Reopens,"The market didn't crash. The 684-point fall doesn't even make history's top 10 percentage declines. And so we may conclude that if Congress now does the right thing quickly on tax policy, the market will rise.</br></br>Problem is, the early indications we're getting is that Congress may enact a new tax bill using conventional means, such as tax credits, mainly to shore up the largest corporations. Incentives at the margin will be minimal. That is, half a loaf.</br></br>The outlook would be considerably more worrisome had the market's indices spent the whole of yesterday in a steady, precipitous decline. The reality is that most of the day's 7.13% loss occurred in the first hour of trading, and remained fairly flat through the day.</br></br>A 684-point drop is a rough ride, and the burden on the market at the opening bell was substantial. The economy before last week was already in the doldrums, with little upside evident so far from a series of interest rate cuts, or for that matter the tax rebate. Much of the airline industry has suffered for years from fixed union costs that leave little room for sustained profitability. The closure of the air transport system may have merely pitched several airlines toward inevitable dissolution, which would be reflected in yesterday's trading.</br></br>That said, share prices generally rose in Europe, and Asia's losses were modest. It is a small miracle that trading in New York opened at all; most likely operations will smooth in the weeks and months ahead.

She's particularly encouraged by a rebound in earnings among smaller concerns in basic industries such as manufacturing, trucking, mining, chemicals and paper. After two years of anemic earnings, third-quarter profits in that group rose 1.5% from a year earlier and are ahead of expectations, she said. Smaller makers of auto parts, household furniture and other economically sensitive goods also exceeded hopes with a 4.2% rise in third-quarter profits, she added.</br></br>Makers of consumer staples and healthcare related companies continued to march ahead, with profits up 45.1% and 42.8%, respectively -- but some health-care earnings came in below expectations, she warned.

But higher oil prices and the growing suspicion that the Federal Reserve won't relax its grip on interest rates anytime soon caused long-term bonds to drop slightly. The dollar strengthened as currency traders also had second thoughts about Fed policy.</br></br>As expected, the stock market opened on a down note as investors took profits following the nearly 42-point gain in the Dow Jones Industrial Average Tuesday. That gain was prompted by a lower-than-expected rise in the March consumer-price index and a sharp drop in housing starts in March. Investors interpreted those figures to mean that the economy is slowing and inflation pressures are fading. But prices quickly recovered and remained higher throughout the day.</br></br>A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research, warned that stock investors appear to be buying the argument -- which he rejects -- that a slower economy will be good for stocks because inflationary pressures will ease.

In Europe, borrowing by companies so far in March is already more than 60% of February's totals.</br></br>""It tells us that financial liquidity is very much on the rise,"" said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service. ""No longer do corporations suffer from a dearth of liquidity.

The resurgence of the corporate debt markets comes after a shaky February, when several companies were forced to delay bond sales as worries about Greece's problems sent investors fleeing to safer assets such as U.S. Treasurys. Those concerns have subsided and money is again flowing into corporate bond funds, giving managers cash to invest.</br></br>Risk premiums, the extra interest corporate borrowers pay over U.S. Treasurys, are falling again for corporate bonds. This allows companies to seize the opportunity to borrow cheaply. The raft of sales point to an increase in economic activity as companies can use the money on new business spending, hiring and mergers.

842615425,3,9/3/12,There Is No 'Structural' Unemployment Problem,,"The unemployment rate has exceeded 8% for more than three years. This has lead some commentators and policy makers to speculate that there has been a fundamental change in the labor market. The view is that today's economy cannot support unemployment rates below 5%--like the levels that prevailed before the recession and in the late 1990s. Those in government may take some comfort in this view. It lowers expectations and provides a rationale for the dismal labor market.</br></br>Excuses aside, this issue is also important for central banks. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have some policy choices to make if the high rates of unemployment reflect cyclic phenomena. But if the problem is structural--perhaps reflecting a mismatch between skills needed by business and skills possessed by the unemployed--there is little the Fed can do.</br></br>Research I've done with James Spletzer of the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the problems in the labor market are not structural. They reflect slow economic growth, and the cure is a decent recovery.</br></br>In 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4%. Two years later, it reached 10%. The structure of a modern economy does not change that quickly. The demographic composition of the labor force, its educational breakdown and even the industrial mix did not differ much between 2007 and 2009.</br></br>More specifically, from 2007 to 2009 unemployment grew dramatically in a few industries, and these changes contributed to the rise in overall unemployment. But the changes were similar to those experienced in prior recessions. As unemployment rates declined somewhat after 2009, the pattern played out in reverse. Industries that saw the largest increases in unemployment were the ones with the largest decreases as overall unemployment fell.",,

Although inflation isn't likely to return to double-digit territory, some analysts said they foresee consumer prices rising at a 6%-to-7% annual clip later this year, up sharply from last year's 3.8% increase.</br></br>Moreover, some economists predicted that the U.S. dollar will tumble in the foreign-exchange markets this year. That would make imported goods more expensive in the U.S., intensifying inflationary pressures. As the inflation rate rises, investors will demand higher interest rates to compensate for the loss of the dollar's buying power, these analysts said.</br></br>The dollar's fate ""is the wild card in the outlook for inflation and interest rates,"" said David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services Inc., Chicago. ""The dollar will fall at least 10%"" this year against other major currencies, he contended. There is an even chance that the dollar could plunge 20%, he added.</br></br>Mr. Hale predicted that the inflation rate will rise to between 5% and 6% by autumn. The closely watched interest rate on federal funds, which has hovered at about 9 1/2% in recent months, will rise to the 10% to 11% area by year end, he said. The rate on federal funds, which are reserves that banks lend each other, strongly influences other interest rates.",,,

The November reading was initially estimated at 133.5. December's decline marked the third consecutive decrease in the closely watched index, which has lost 14 points since September. The reading compares results with its base year of 1985 when the index was 100. A sharp decrease in household expectations about the future health of the economy accounted for much of the drop.</br></br>The New York business-research firm's data are the latest in a string of reports that depict an economy slowing more sharply, and more quickly, than anticipated. The cooling economy has led the Federal Reserve to formally identify slower growth, not inflation, as the biggest current threat to the economy, and analysts expect the central bank to begin cutting interest rates next year to spur growth.</br></br>Although most sectors of the economy have begun to slow, the drop in consumer confidence is especially troubling because household fears about a recession can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Consumer spending accounts for nearly two-thirds of the nation's total economic activity; shrinking consumer confidence would probably cause spending to slow. A sharp drop-off in spending then could turn a relatively soft landing into a much bumpier one.</br></br>That prospect was very much on the minds of Conference Board officials, who described the fall in confidence as ""somewhat disconcerting.""",,,

Last year, U.S. exports, industrial production, real hourly compensation, corporate profits, federal tax revenues, retail sales, GDP, productivity, the number of people with jobs, the number of students in college, airline passenger traffic and the Dow Jones Industrial Average all hit record levels. For the third consecutive year, global growth was strong, continuing to lift (and hold) millions of people out of poverty.

842615601,4,6/28/99,The Fed's Inflated Expectations,"With the sort of attention usually reserved for royal weddings, the Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve convenes today and tomorrow to determine whether or not to leave the current federal funds rate unchanged. In the course of their deliberations, which closely resemble an academic seminar, the Fed governors will take into account everything from the unexpectedly large increase in the April consumer price index to its benign follow-up in May to Japan's first-quarter growth. The probable result of all this activity: a rate hike of one-quarter of one percentage point.</br></br>Why so much attention to an event once known only to Fed watchers at investment banks? The reason has little to do with whether and by how much the Fed raises the rate, though this will of course have some bearing on the immediate direction of the markets. What really matters, however, is what the Fed's action suggests about its view of the future of inflation.</br></br>After decades in which mainstream economists held that the costs of inflation were negligible, and that an inflationary monetary policy could stimulate economic growth, it is now widely appreciated (thanks to the work of Milton Friedman, Robert Lucas, Martin Feldstein and others) that stable, low inflation is essential to longer expansions and stronger growth. Thus the intense speculation: Will tomorrow be the start of another ""long march,"" a 300 basis point increase such as began in 1988 and 1994 to ward off inflation? Is the Fed going to reverse the 75 basis point decrease in interest rates in response to the last year's global turmoil and the prospect of deflation?</br></br>The change in forecasts of what the Fed will and should do has been rapid. As recently as late February, the Economist magazine ran a cover story worrying about the risk of global deflation; a few weeks later it hawkishly editorialized that the Fed was late in raising interest rates. Behind these large swings in opinion lie some unresolved questions about the economy, among them:</br></br>-- Why has inflation continued to decelerate? Is it due to a string of one-time favorable ""shocks,"" such as low oil prices, a strong dollar, and a steeper than anticipated decline in computer prices? Has that string run out?",,,

Since the last boom-bust cycle in the oil industry, many of those economies have diversified into industries more closely linked to the general U.S. economy. Thus, the reasoning goes, if higher energy costs cause a recession in the rest of the U.S., states such as Texas would suffer too.</br></br>According to Sandra J. Flannigan, an analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons Inc., Baltimore, oil and gas accounted for only 15% of Texas's economic output in 1989, compared with a peak of 27% in 1981.</br></br>Energy companies, worried that prices could sink again as fast as they rose, are being much more cautious about new investments and exploration this time.

Then, the stock market's plunge was much more severe in percentage terms than any of the dips in the past few days. Still, outside of the financial sector, the economy didn't feel any ripple effects until around mid-1989, notes Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management.</br></br>The 1987 market plunge was steeper than any of the market slides that have coincided with recessions in the past few decades. And many economists believe that, to hurt the economy, today's market would have to suffer consistent and considerably worse drops than it has shown recently. Even then, Mr. Fine says, ""only at some future point"" would it damage consumer spending and other economic sectors.</br></br>In the high-technology sector, where the recent drop has been severe, tumbling stock prices are a reflection of worsening industry performance, said Kenneth R.

Housing ""is set to exert a longer and more potent than expected drag"" on the U.S. economy, said Jean-Philippe Cotis, chief economist for the Paris-based economic think tank. Consumers will also be tested by ""mortgage rate resets, tighter credit standards, weaker collaterals and slower job creation."" In a press briefing, Mr. Costis also said he expects the Federal Reserve to ease rates sooner rather than later. Another ominous, yet inconclusive, indicator of the direction of the U.S. economy out early Wednesday, the ADP National Employment Report, said that jobs in the private sector rose by 38,000 in August, much less than expectations. This data tidbit shined one of the first statistical spotlights on the economy in August, when the worries over exposure to subprime securities spooked investors out of credit markets. Still, Goldman Sachs economists warned that the ADP report ""gives a picture of the labor market for the week of Aug. 12, only part way through the market turmoil and before employment could really react to the ongoing credit crunch. More weakness could well be yet to come.""</br></br>Also out Wednesday were housing numbers from the National Association of Realtors. The group's index of pending sales of existing homes decreased at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 12.2% in July from June, the industry group said Wednesday. The NAR index, based on signed contracts for previously owned homes, was 16.1% below the level of July 2006. An NAR statement accompanying the data release also suggested existing-home sales will likely sag more as mortgage disruptions tied to credit concerns work their way into the housing market. BNP Paribas economists noted that ""most worryingly is that this report is clearly 'pre-turmoil', reflecting resale transactions agreed in July, so before August's financial market turmoil, lurch higher in jumbo mortgage rates and the freezing over of much of the mortgage market. How bad next month's pending sales index (and this month's new home sales report) might be is really quite frightening."" Still more economic reports are on tap for later today, when the Federal Reserve will release its ""beige book"" report.

That is the market's response to Obama administration efforts to reverse core American principles of growth and prosperity.</br></br>These principles include a sound dollar to provide price stability and to attract capital; a commitment to limited government as a prerequisite for higher living standards; a preference for low tax rates to encourage investment and hiring; and a belief that markets can set prices and allocate capital better than governments.</br></br>The administration will have spent more than $14 trillion in just four years and added $6 trillion to the national debt. The Federal Reserve has dramatically expanded its role in the economy and markets, practically creating a new branch of government. Its near-zero interest-rate policy favors government, the world's biggest borrower, at the expense of private-sector savers. The Fed's heavily leveraged purchases of government bonds work against the market-based allocation of capital that is a key driver of economic growth. The Fed has now promised to make unlimited future purchases of government debt if job growth remains weak, an affront to the principle of limited government.",,
842615778,6,12/3/07,Why Dollar May Be Set for a Rebound,"Beating down the dollar has become a popular sport lately. But the greenback may be about to get off the mat.</br></br>The dollar's decline this year has been unrelenting. It has fallen 5% against the pound, 7% against the yen, 10% against the euro and 14% against the Canadian dollar. Against the Federal Reserve's trade- weighted basket of currencies, the dollar has dropped 8%.</br></br>For years, most economists have viewed the dollar as an accident waiting to happen. To finance its huge trade deficit, the U.S. has been borrowing heavily from the rest of the world. The thinking was that overseas savers eventually would tire of holding ever-greater quantities of dollar-based assets. When they'd had enough, the dollar would fall.</br></br>And so it has. Many economists think the dollar will weaken further. Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California at Berkeley and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University calculated in 2005 that with the broadest measure of the U.S. trade deficit -- the current account -- running at more than 6% of the nation's economic output, the dollar needed to fall as much as 30% against the Fed's currency basket to bring the trade deficit back into balance. (A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports cheaper to foreigners and makes imports costlier for Americans, shrinking the trade gap, as has been happening lately.)</br></br>By that reckoning, the dollar needs to drop an additional 20%. And the Fed's new openness to cutting interest rates, if the textbooks are right, should further weaken the currency as global investors flock to places with higher returns.",,,

842615791,7,4/10/06,Help (Very Much) Wanted,"Friday's bullish report of 211,000 new jobs in March and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.7% -- matching its lowest level in five years -- brings further evidence that the great American jobs machine rolls on. Since May of 2003, U.S. businesses have created 5.2 million new jobs. The highly publicized layoffs of 50,000 workers by Ford and General Motors over the next two years is the number of net new jobs the U.S. economy is producing every week in other industries.</br></br>In such high-growth regions as the Southeast and Mountain West, the problem is a shortage of willing and trained workers. Thank goodness for immigrant workers who are filling vital niches in the labor force. Critics continue to complain that President Bush's tax policies have only benefited the super-wealthy, but that would come as news to the five million Americans who were jobless before the 2003 tax cuts, and thus had no income, but now have a weekly paycheck.</br></br>Employers are on enough of a hiring spree that some Wall Street economists of the Keynesian persuasion are fretting over wage-push inflationary pressures. Inflationary pressures do exist due to a Federal Reserve policy of excess dollar liquidity, as evidenced by the $600 price of gold futures. But this is a problem for monetary policy. More people working increases the supply of goods and services, which forces prices down, not up.</br></br>Since at least February of 2004, wages have been rising at a slightly faster pace than core inflation, and the median wage has climbed to more than $600 a week for the first time ever. These pay hikes are a result of another hallmark of this expansion: rapid productivity growth, particularly in manufacturing. So workers are benefiting from a labor market trifecta: robust expansion in jobs, steady gains in productivity and gains in real take-home pay.</br></br>This employment boom once again stands in contrast to the jobs depression in France. Thanks to much more flexible work rules, ease of hiring and firing, lower government benefits for not working, and lower taxes on employers (29.6% of employer costs in the U.S. versus 47.4% in France), more than half of America's 15-to-24-year-olds have jobs, versus only about one-in-four in France.",,,

Those tactics include unbridled partisanship, procedural short cuts, demands for swift passage of bills, and promises of quick results.</br></br>With large majorities in Congress and an obsequious press corps, Mr. Obama was smitten with the idea of emulating President Franklin Roosevelt's First 100 Days of legislative success in 1933.

There They Go Again,"Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle has now staked out his and his party's economic policies, and -- in tune with the styles of today -- they're retro. The Bush tax cuts, he says, could actually be making the recession worse.</br></br>To a veteran of the Reagan administration, all of this sounds pretty familiar. In 1981, shortly after the enactment of the Reagan tax cut, the economy slid into a serious recession. The tax cut, combined with the recession, resulted in a substantial deficit in 1982, and deficits ""as far as the eye could see"" thereafter.</br></br>Ronald Reagan's economic plan -- based on supply-side theory -- was a relatively new idea at the time, and the severe recession spread alarm through the political community. The deficits, it was thought, would bring back inflation, cause interest rates to rise, worsen the recession and slow or defer any recovery. The president was implored to back a tax increase, not just by the Democrats -- who wanted desperately to repeal or defer the tax cut -- but also by Republicans, who feared that the recession would decimate their ranks in the 1982 election.</br></br>Even members of the president's staff lost their nerve, with leaks from the White House complaining that Mr. Reagan would not listen to reason, and budget director David Stockman being quoted in a magazine article to the effect that Mr. Reagan didn't know what he was doing. Alone among the president's advisers, Treasury Secretary Donald Regan made the obvious point: It's absurd to raise taxes in the midst of a recession. Mr. Reagan, bless his stubborn heart, agreed with his treasury secretary and, as he put it, ""stayed the course.""</br></br>Sure enough, the economy didn't just recover -- it boomed. Despite the deficits, which did indeed continue at historic peacetime levels through Mr. Reagan's two terms in office, inflation and interest rates declined. The nation shook off the strange combination of slow growth and inflation that characterized the Carter years and grew at a healthy rate through the rest of the 1980s. The stock market, recognizing that a new and different economic policy had taken hold in Washington, surged to unprecedented levels.",,,

We believe that 2009 will be tougher than many anticipate.</br></br>We enter the new year grappling with the most serious global economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression. The U.S. economy is, at best, halfway through a recession that began in December 2007 and will prove the longest and most severe of the postwar period. Credit losses of close to $3 trillion are leaving the U.S. banking and financial system insolvent. And the credit crunch will persist as households, financial firms and corporations with high debt ratios and solvency problems undergo a sharp deleveraging process.</br></br>Worse, all of the world's advanced economies are in recession. Many emerging markets, including China, face the threat of a hard landing. Some fear that these conditions will produce a dangerous spike in inflation, but the greater risk is for a kind of global ""stag-deflation"": a toxic combination of economic stagnation, recession and falling prices. We're likely to see vulnerable European markets (Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria), key Latin American markets (Argentina, Venezuela, Ecuador and Mexico), Asian countries (Pakistan, Indonesia and South Korea), and countries like Russia, Ukraine and the Baltic states facing severe financial pressure.</br></br>Policy remedies will have limited effect as insolvency problems constrain the effectiveness of monetary stimulus, and the risk of rising interest rates (following the issuance of a wave of public debt) erodes the growth effects of fiscal stimulus packages. Only when insolvent banks are shut down, others are cleaned up, and the debt level of insolvent households is reduced will conditions ease. Between now and then, we can expect further downside risks to equity markets and other risky assets, given the likelihood that markets will continue to be jolted by worse-than-expected financial news.</br></br>The U.S. twin fiscal and current-account deficits will rise over the next two years as the country runs trillion dollar-plus fiscal deficits. We're all aware that foreign actors have financed most of this debt over the past several years.

One possible option is to take equity stakes, such as buying preferred stock, under terms that are favorable to the institution.</br></br>While details are still being discussed, the program would most likely be voluntary and aimed at encouraging healthy institutions to participate.

Much of it is concentrated in the energy and basic materials sectors, and reflects a decline in commodity prices that is helping drive down costs to other companies, as well as consumers.</br></br>And once again, the overall weakness in revenue seems concentrated in companies' foreign, rather than domestic, operations. Some evidence for that: Friday's gross domestic product report for the U.S. showed that final sales to domestic purchasers were up 3% in the first quarter.

His annual year-end forecast is based on the dollar's historic trading pattern in Decembers.

842616100,3,1/4/88,The Outlook: Recession-Free 1988? Don't Bet the Ranch,"NEW YORK -- Whenever a new year rolls around, the outlook for business invariably receives more than the usual amount of attention. The start of 1988 is no exception. Indeed, the degree of interest seems exceptional even for a new year. This reflects concern that last fall's stock-market crash may have signaled an approaching recession, as well as uneasiness over the extraordinary longevity of the expansion, which reached the five-year mark in November.</br></br>Happily, most forecasters reckon that the economy will keep expanding as 1988 unfolds. But this consensus deserves close scrutiny. It expects only a sluggish advance, with overall business activity rising about 2%. Such a pace would provide a perilously slim cushion in the event of unpleasant surprises. And important considerations point to just such a possibility.</br></br>Primary among these considerations is the cautionary message provided by last October's market crash.</br></br>This century has witnessed only eight earlier declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that approximately matched or exceeded the 1987 slide -- from August 25 to October 19, a wrenching 36.1% drop. In seven of the eight previous declines, as recently noted on this page, the economy also slumped, sometimes starting down at roughly the same time as the market and sometimes more than a year later. The sole exception was in World War II when, with the all-out military buildup, the economy kept rising even though share prices fell more than 40%.</br></br>In predicting more recession-free growth as 1988 goes along, most forecasters apparently believe that the recent 36.1% market slide will prove another exception to the century-long record.

""There is some sign here that policy should continue to err on the side of containing inflation.""</br></br>But the Fed is unlikely to take decisive action before the Dec. 14 meeting unless it is confronted with a steep decline in the dollar.

However the core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, jumped 0.3% last month, the largest increase since June 2008. A 9.3% rise in tobacco prices generated about 40% of the core CPI increase as a federal excise tax kicked in. It was the second-straight month that tobacco lifted the core index.</br></br>Separately, U.S. industrial production fell 0.5% in April, its 15th decline in 16 months, an indication that businesses continue to draw down inventories in the face of weak demand. Meanwhile, a gauge of consumer sentiment by Reuters and the University of Michigan rose to 67.9 in mid-May, from 65.1 in April.

If only it were true. The longest and worst recession since the end of World War II has been marked by the weakest recovery from any U.S. recession in that same period.</br></br>The jobless nature of the recovery is particularly unsettling. In June, the government's Household Survey reported that since the start of the year, the number of people with jobs increased by 753,000 -- but there are jobs and then there are ""jobs."" No fewer than 557,000 of these positions were only part-time. The survey also reported that in June full-time jobs declined by 240,000, while part-time jobs soared by 360,000 and have now reached an all-time high of 28,059,000 -- three million more part-time positions than when the recession began at the end of 2007.</br></br>That's just for starters. The survey includes part-time workers who want full-time work but can't get it, as well as those who want to work but have stopped looking. That puts the real unemployment rate for June at 14.3%, up from 13.8% in May.</br></br>The 7.6% unemployment figure so common in headlines these days is utterly misleading. An estimated 22 million Americans are unemployed or underemployed; they are virtually invisible and mostly excluded from unemployment calculations that garner headlines.</br></br>At this stage of an expansion you would expect the number of part-time jobs to be declining, as companies would be doing more full-time hiring. Not this time. In the long misery of this post-recession period, we have an extraordinary situation: Americans by the millions are in part-time work because there are no other employment opportunities as businesses increase their reliance on independent contractors and part-time, temporary and seasonal employees.",,,

But Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he expected the 1984 deficit to widen further, with imports exceeding exports by perhaps $100 billion.</br></br>The effect of these trade woes has been widespread, even extending to industries where the U.S. traditionally has had an edge over foreign competitors -- such as telecommunications and machinery. David Ernst, vice president of Evans Economics here, says the deficit cost the U.S. 1.5 million jobs in 1983.</br></br>The main reason the deficit is so large, most economists agree, is the high value of the dollar, which has risen some 30% against other major currencies since 1980. That makes U.S. exports more expensive overseas and foreign goods cheaper in the U.S. As a result, ""American firms have a 30% cost disadvantage in world markets,"" complains Jack Albertine, who heads a trade association of medium-size, fast-growth companies called the American Business Conference.</br></br>The dollar's high value results primarily from high inflation-adjusted interest rates, which attract foreign savings to this country, according to the conventional analysis.

Now some home builders, worried that rising interest rates may clip the pace of new sales, have gotten into the act by making cheaper financing available to home buyers.</br></br>While the builders aren't offering no-interest loans, in some areas they are undercutting the rates offered by more traditional lenders. To entice buyers, big national builders such as KB Homes and smaller developers such as Estridge Companies in Carmel, Ind., are providing incentives ranging from below-market loans to offers to lock in low rates for up to six months.</br></br>In formerly hot markets like Denver and Austin, Texas, builders are sweetening financing deals, paying as much as $4,000 on a $200,000 mortgage to cover a buyer's closing costs.</br></br>Rising rates are expected to play an increasingly important role in the housing market during coming months.

Excluding volatile food and energy prices, so- called core consumer prices -- which are believed to give a more stable reading of inflation -- advanced just 0.1% last month. And the year-over-year rate of inflation, at 4.9%, is coming down from high levels reached this summer.</br></br>There was widespread softness in pricing. Transportation prices fell 0.6% as airline fares and new-car prices dropped. Housing, which accounts for 40% of the consumer-price index, fell 0.1% for a second straight month, the first back-to-back declines since 2001. Clothing prices fell 0.1% for the month.</br></br>Other signs of economic weakness are building, including a report by the Fed on Thursday that U.S. industrial production dropped sharply in September.</br></br>The inflation readings underscore a growing belief inside the Fed that inflation pressures are easing, as many senior officials expected earlier this year. Indeed, financial shocks like the one the U.S. is experiencing could eventually lead to the opposite of inflation -- deflation, or a broad decline in prices -- though that doesn't look like a serious risk, given the amount of stimulus going into the U.S. economy.",,,

He figured ""there must be money out there if people are willing to pay that much"" for bluejeans.

U.S. gross domestic product expanded, on average, at a 3.7% annual rate during the first nine months, and, as of November, the consumer-price index was up 3.5% from a year earlier.

He attributed this in part to tax law changes, including the phasing out of many deductions, that apparently have caused individuals and businesses to increase payments of estimated taxes.</br></br>At the same time, however, the Commerce Department has said that in January some people were having too little tax withheld from their paychecks because they hadn't accurately readjusted their withholding under the new law.

842616434,3,11/24/10,Central Bank's Mandate Draws a Spotlight,"With unemployment at 9.6% and inflation below the Federal Reserve's working definition of ""price stability,"" this seems a strange moment for Congress to contemplate instructing the Fed to focus exclusively on fighting inflation.</br></br>But Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) wants to revive that notion, which has lain dormant for more than a decade because there has been so little inflation. ""I am concerned about inflation down the road,"" he explains. ""The time is right for us to bring clarity to the Fed."" In the House, Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) and Michael Pence (R., Ind.) agree. Mr. Pence argues that the Fed's quest to combat unemployment by buying $600 billion in U.S. Treasurys is a failure and threatens to ""monetize our debt and trigger inflation.""</br></br>The implication is that the Fed has lost its moorings. Has it really? For more than 30 years, Congress has charged the Fed with aiming at ""maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates."" That wording has long made some Fed officials and academic economists uneasy because it is rooted in a now-abandoned view that the government could dial up a little more inflation to get a little less unemployment and vice versa.</br></br>The current consensus is that the Fed can -- and, indeed, is now attempting to -- reduce unemployment in a recession, but in the long run can deliver only price stability. What Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke calls ""the longer-run sustainable unemployment rate"" is determined by demographics, job-market rules and other factors beyond the Fed's control. In this view, if the Fed tried to push unemployment too low now, it could create too much inflation later, the mistake the Fed made in the late 1970s.</br></br>But it is not the 1970s. Even though the Fed has been holding short-term interest rates near zero for nearly two years, prices rose at only a 1% annual rate in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Tuesday. No measure of inflation expectations foresees anything like the 8%-plus inflation of the '70s. And it's hard to find a single Greenspan or Bernanke decision that would have been different if they had an inflation-only mandate. So why all this now?",,,

The gain amounted to roughly $75.2 billion. At the same time, consumer spending increased 0.9%, about $76.7 billion, the largest climb in six months.</br></br>The January spending jump follows a soft fourth quarter, which led economists and retailers to worry about an economic slowdown. But the latest data confirm other recent reports that show consumer spending picked up again in January, and that the broad-based gains should ripple throughout the economy.</br></br>Consumer spending is ""strengthening sharply in the first quarter"" said Dean Maki, chief U.S. economist at Barclays Capital. He estimates that consumer spending in the first quarter will grow at an annualized rate of 4.5% or more, compared with 1.2% in the fourth quarter. Spending is ""recovering after the post-hurricane lull"" and sluggish auto sales late last year, he said.</br></br>The large gain in personal income was the result mainly of rising wages and salaries, which partly reflects rising employment. The economy added 193,000 new nonfarm jobs in January. But Uncle Sam also contributed to the January income increase as the Medicare prescription-drug plan, an increase in cost-of-living adjustments for recipients of Social Security and some other federal programs boosted transfer payments. Meantime, pay raises for federal civilian and military personnel boosted government wage and salary disbursements.

While profitability and stock prices usually rise when leaders share their subordinates' pay pain, pressure to pinch executive pay harder could weaken carriers' chances for recovery by increasing the tempo of management turnover.</br></br>""If you pay below market, you get what you pay for,"" says a former vice president of a troubled major carrier who joined a start-up airline earlier this month. ""You will be left with the 'B' team.""</br></br>As it now stands, virtually no upper-management wallet at sick airlines remains untouched, but the extent of slimmed compensation varies by carrier. Delta's chief executive officer, Gerald Grinstein, skipped his $500,000 annual salary for six months last year. And since he became head of the Atlanta airline in January 2004 (after having been a Delta board member), Mr. Grinstein has taken no other remuneration.",,,

842616510,7,2/14/95,Clinton aides see improving trend in productivity,"WASHINGTON -- President Clinton's economic advisers say the trend in U.S. productivity growth may be improving, boosting the prospects for growth in living standards in coming years.</br></br>The Economic Report of the President, released yesterday, said the growth in U.S. productivity, which is a measure of the output per hour worked, has averaged about 2% a year since 1991 -- more than twice the 1978-87 average. Some of that may reflect a rebound from the recession; but even if measured from 1987, productivity has grown 1.2%, up from 0.9% in the 10 previous years.</br></br>""There may have, indeed, been a structural change"" in productivity growth, said Laura Tyson, chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. Such an increase could have positive implications for Americans' standards of living, which are ultimately determined by the productivity of American workers.</br></br>But the president's economic report also points out that it may be too soon to jump to conclusions about productivity growth. For one thing, the statistics can be misleading. If the trends are computed for different periods -- 1978-86 and 1986-94 -- productivity growth averages only 1.1% in the latest period, up from 1% in the earlier period, not much of a difference. Also, recently released Labor Department data on hours worked suggest that productivity could be revised downward by one-tenth of a percentage point in 1993 and 1994.</br></br>""While the evidence of a slight improvement in the productivity growth trend is encouraging, it is not yet decisive,"" the report said, adding that two more years of data may present a clearer picture.",,,

842616519,3,7/10/01,Labor Statistics Are Lying,"On Friday the Labor Department released employment data for June. The employment report is the most important monthly statistical release the government produces and the focus is always on the unemployment rate and the monthly change in payroll employment. The June report showed a slight rise in the unemployment rate to 4.5% and a relatively small fall in payroll employment of 114,000 jobs.</br></br>The market took those statistics badly. The stock market sold off, as did the long Treasury bond. Stocks were looking for more cost-cutting measures from companies, in this case a bigger drop in payroll employment. Bonds were looking for a stronger signal that the economy was weak and that the Federal Reserve would continue cutting interest rates.</br></br>But there is a little secret in the employment report that you should know about. The Labor Department said that payroll employment fell 114,000 in June. What it did not tell you is that this reported change includes a ""bias adjustment factor"" that adds about 160,000 jobs a month. This bias factor is basically picked out of thin air, and is supposed to capture employment in newly started firms that Labor misses in its survey. In other words, Labor doesn't know how many new hires occurred at new companies, so it assume a number. In its June report, it continued to guess that it missed 155,000 new hires.</br></br>The problem is that when the economy slumps, so do new business start-ups. A good indicator of new business starts is the Conference Board's index of help-wanted advertising. This index has plummeted back to levels last seen at the end of the 1990 recession. Back then, the bias factor also fell to zero, instead of hanging at the same level as in the boom period of 1998.</br></br>Compare the published payroll survey with another measure of employment, the Labor Department's household survey, which measures employment by asking a survey of people, not businesses, if they have lost their job. The household survey is used to calculate the unemployment rate, but is otherwise ignored because it is very volatile from month to month. Over the past five months this survey shows a fall in employment of more than one million. Over the same five months the published payroll survey has fallen only 45,000. However, if you remove the monthly addition of 155,000 from the bias factor, payroll employment would be down 269,000 in June and 872,000 over the past five months. Now we're talking big numbers.",,,

The economy at the time was growing at a healthy pace with few signs of overheating. But with reports across the U.S. indicating a bubble in the housing market, the Federal Open Market Committee spent time assessing the appreciation in home prices and what, if anything, the Fed could do about it. Fed staff economists had found that housing might be overvalued by as much as 20%, based on the historical relationship between prices and rents.</br></br>But Fed officials appeared hamstrung because they believed their most important tool--interest rates--could not address frothy housing markets alone without influencing the broader economy.</br></br>""I get very irritated when I see columns suggesting that we are trying to inspire or should be trying to prick a housing bubble,"" said Fed Governor Edward Gramlich, who died in 2007.

842616679,4,12/30/02,`Reflation' Comes Into Focus as U.S. Struggles to Battle Deflation,"INFLATION. DEFLATION. Disinflation. The economic lexicon is garbled with so many 'flations these days, it's getting a little hard to make sense of them all. During the 1970s, '80s and '90s, Washington policy makers waged a persistent battle against inflation, broadly defined as rising consumer prices. But for most of this year, as the inflation rate has fallen closer to zero, economists began to worry about the opposite trend -- the possibility that the U.S. could face Japan-style deflation, or falling consumer prices.</br></br>As we enter 2003, here comes a new watchword: reflation. The term refers to government efforts to pump up -- or reflate -- an economy that is stuck in a slump by flooding that economy with money. Essentially, reflation is the intentional effort by governments to ward off deflation by boosting demand and underpinning prices. Though it isn't quite the same as inflation, reflation can spark inflation problems if policy makers go too far.</br></br>The term is popping up often. In a recent report titled ""The Reflation Trade,"" Morgan Stanley Co. chief economist Stephen Roach argued that policy makers are now in a ""full-scale frontal assault on the perils of deflation."" That has made him more bullish on the stock market in the months ahead. James Grant, in his twice-monthly newsletter, Grant's Interest Rate Observer, writes about a ""global reflation program"" being led by the U.S. and spreading world-wide. That, he said, explains why prices for gold -- a hedge against inflation and his favorite investment -- are on the rise.</br></br>SOME ECONOMISTS who have been beating deflation drums are doing an about-face. ""There has been an important shift. The financial community is talking more about reflation . . . it is the thing to watch in 2003,"" says Paul McCulley, chief economist at Pacific Investment Management Co., the California bond-fund manager that recently advised clients that government-bond yields will rise as result of today's reflation tilt.</br></br>Behind the reflation focus is blunt talk by Federal Reserve officials. Earlier this month, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told economists in New York that while deflation is only a remote possibility, the central bank is ""extraordinarily sensitive"" to the potential perils associated with it and is prepared to forestall it if the economy moves further in that direction. In November, Fed governor Ben Bernanke laid out a series of unusual steps the Fed could take to get out of Japan-style deflation if it did happen -- such as lending more aggressively to banks to drive down private borrowing costs or buying foreign government bonds, which could weaken the dollar and boost exports.",,,

The latest figures pointed to a remarkably strong 7.4% annualized gain in inflation-adjusted consumer spending through the first two months of the third quarter, according to Bear Stearns estimates. If that spending pace was sustained through September -- final data won't be available until next month -- it would be the largest quarterly spending increase since 1985.</br></br>""Massive tax relief has boosted disposable income and real consumer spending,"" Steven Wood, an economist with Insight Economics, said in a note to clients. ""This fiscal stimulus will provide a strong boost to third-quarter"" growth.</br></br>It is still too early to say whether the latest spurt of spending will be sustainable. Consumer-confidence surveys remain soft, in part because companies haven't started hiring en masse, and that is restraining wages and salaries. Some economists warn that the recent jump in spending will wane as the initial impetus of tax cuts wears off. However the latest reports suggest the tax cuts at least helped set the tone for a summer of sizzling consumer spending.</br></br>""People are slowly starting to get more and more confident,"" says Myron Markewycz, general manager of One Sixtyblue, a fine-dining restaurant in Chicago that has seen sales of $32 Delmonico steaks and $100 bottles of wine pick up sharply in the past two months.",,,

Finally, the real Fed funds rate has been negative for two years and relative to real economic growth, the most negative since the inflationary '70s.</br></br>But there are good responses to these points. The rising commodity prices are due to China, which is churning out lower priced goods that keep inflation in check. The dollar has indeed dropped, but two years ago economists were saying it was too high. Today it's at, or just below, its purchasing power parity level, consistent with the persistent current account deficit. Furthermore, the smart money in the oil futures market says that the price is coming down sharply. And there is also a good response to the low real rates, a key variable in the critics' argument. Inflation hawks have maintained that by keeping the after-inflation cost of money negative, the Fed is feeding the fires of future inflation.</br></br>But if monetary policy were really too accommodating, wouldn't we see rising interest rates in the bond market? Yet with the 10-year bond yield under 4%, we see no such concern. Are those calling for higher rates saying that the bond vigilantes -- who have kept government and the Fed honest by pushing bond prices lower when the Fed's action has been inflationary -- are flat out wrong? That would be a sharp reversal from the past when the bond market was routinely praised for warning errant governments of monetary and fiscal profligacy.</br></br>With the 10-year indexed bond yielding a record-low 1.4%, a zero or even negative real Fed funds rate -- what we have now -- looks about right. If the Fed raised short-term rates, it would risk flattening or inverting the yield curve, something very dangerous early in a recovery.",,,

842616789,4,10/2/01,The Dismal Science: The Best Way to Give Business a Boost,"Today, the Bush administration and Congress will start squinting their collective eyes at a bunch of proposals to cut taxes on business. They are responding to the fact that the current economic weakness started back with a steep fall-off in business investment. That fall-off has likely accelerated after Sept. 11, and their hope is to produce a tax package that will encourage capital spending.</br></br>The two hottest ideas at the moment are speeding up depreciation on plant and equipment, as well as a cut in the corporate income tax rate. Both are sensible for establishing conditions for economic growth, although both ideas could be improved upon:</br></br>-- Faster depreciation or, even better, immediate expensing.</br></br>Currently, business investment cannot be fully expensed in the year it is made, but must be depreciated over time. Depending on asset class, that time can be anywhere from several years to almost three decades. This delay leaves the value of the write-off exposed to twin evils: losses in the time value of money (a dollar in hand is worth more than a dollar promised) and losses due to inflation. If, however, businesses could write-off the entire value of a capital investment in the year it is undertaken -- expense the investment -- the erosion and risk associated with long depreciation schedules would disappear.</br></br>If immediate expensing weren't possible, even faster depreciation would reduce those dangers. Either way, capital investment would look more attractive to business and, accordingly, more such investment would be undertaken. This could be the start of a virtuous cycle in which more capital formation increases labor productivity that, in turn, raises wages.",,,
842616802,5,1/8/11,The Jobs Report: Economic Benchmark Proves Hard to Gauge,"Friday's official report on the U.S. labor market was a contrast with other data suggesting stronger improvement last month. What's behind the disparities?</br></br>Much of the difference comes down to how the employment surveys are conducted and the problems that stem from producing estimates so quickly after the month ends.</br></br>The Labor Department's report is drawn from two separate surveys, one looking at workers in households (to determine the unemployment rate, among other measures) and the other looking at payrolls for businesses (to provide figures on job creation). They don't always match up because they are based on different samples, but in the long run they tend to line up fairly closely. The December payroll survey released Friday showed a modest gain of 103,000 jobs. But the prior two months were revised up by 70,000 jobs. The surprisingly weak November figure moved from a gain of 39,000 jobs, as reported last month, to a gain of 71,000 jobs.</br></br>Why such a large jump in the revision? The estimates for job creation are drawn from a fairly large sample size. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, a unit of the Labor Department, samples about 140,000 businesses and government agencies representing roughly 410,000 work sites.</br></br>But all the surveys don't come back in time for the government to release its initial estimate, usually on the first Friday of the next month. As more results come in, the estimates become more reliable. Labor updates data for the prior two months before considering it final. It also does annual revisions of those figures to account for the creation of new businesses -- a development that is hard to measure during turning points in the economy as companies are shutting down or starting up.",,,

842616830,4,2/3/92,Board of Contributors: Goose the Money Supply,"When Alan Greenspan appears before the Senate and House Banking Committees later this month, a primary focus of his testimony will be the Fed's target for money supply growth during the current year. The decision on that rate of increase will be made during the next two days by the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee.</br></br>There's a good reason that the Federal Reserve is required to report on its target for the growth of the money supply rather than its target for interest rates. The change in the growth of the money supply is a good indicator of where the economy is likely to be headed in the near future. While it is certainly not a perfect indicator, the increase in the broad M2 monetary aggregate (that includes small time deposits and money market mutual funds as well as checking account deposits and currency) is far better than interest rates as a guide to the future growth of total spending in the economy.</br></br>As a rough rule of thumb, experience shows that the rate of growth of total nominal gross domestic product is approximately equal to the rate of increase of M2 six months earlier. Although there have been variations in this relation from year to year, over the past two decades nominal GDP has grown at an annual rate of 8.5% while the stock of M2 has grown by 8.7%. Recent experience also conforms quite closely to this general rule: Total nominal GDP rose 3.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991, while M2 increased by 3.3% from the second quarter of 1990 to the second quarter of 1991.</br></br>The slow growth of nominal GDP last year helped to bring down inflation. But even with only a 3% percent rise of the GDP price deflator during 1991, the 3.2% nominal GDP rise left room for real GDP growth of only 0.2% from the fourth quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1991. A decline of GDP in the first quarter of 1991 was followed by a resumption of growth in the second and third quarters but then a fourth quarter in which real GDP rose only 0.3%. For the year as a whole, real GDP in 1991 was nearly 1% lower than in 1990. This recent slowdown would probably have been avoided if the Federal Reserve had provided faster growth of M2 earlier in the year.</br></br>Looking ahead, the level of economic activity during the first half of 1992 is likely to show very little if any increase because of the very slow growth of the money supply in the second half of 1991. Since M2 grew at an annual rate of only 1.3% from the second quarter of 1991 until the final quarter of the year, the rule of thumb based on past experience implies that nominal GDP will also rise only 1.3% during the first half of 1992. Unless the inflation rate drops below 1.3%, that simple forecasting rule implies no real growth in the first half of 1992.",,,

As investors sought safety in Treasurys, bond yields, which move inversely to prices, fell across the board.</br></br>The benchmark 10-year Treasury note saw its yield fall to 3.390%, from 3.537% Tuesday, as the price rose 1 8/32 points, or $12.50 for every $1,000 invested, to 103 1/32. The 30-year bond surged 3 5/32 points, or $31.5625 for every $1,000 invested, to 109 4/32, to yield 3.972%, from 4.147% Tuesday. The two-year yield fell to 1.110%, the lowest since June 13, 2003.</br></br>Worries about deflation sent the 10-year break-even rate, the yield spread between the 10-year Treasury inflation-protected securities and 10-year nominal Treasurys, to a low of 0.37 percentage point, the lowest level since the Treasury Department started to sell TIPS in 1997.</br></br>The gap suggests investors expect an average annualized inflation of 0.37% over the next decade, adding to the shift over the past few months from inflation concerns to deflation worries.",,,

The weaker dollar, coupled with a report that indicated the economy remains strong in the face of rising short-term interest rates, sent bond prices sprawling. And after that the fall in stock prices was almost anti-climactic.</br></br>The Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 23.93 to 2144.64 after being off nearly 40 points early in the afternoon. Computer-generated trading fueled much of the decline.</br></br>But analysts cautioned that yesterday's price action doesn't necessarily mean the financial markets have nowhere to go but down in 1989. ""I think there's less here than meets the eye,"" said Peter Canelo, a portfolio strategist at Bear Stearns. ""I don't think there's a clear direction on the economy, and there isn't any conviction about interest rates.""</br></br>As 1988 drew to an end, investors were looking for signs that the economy is slowing in reaction to the Federal Reserve's steady effort to drive interest rates higher. Instead, the early evidence points to a stronger than expected economy in December that will require even more interest rate discipline. That hurts bond prices in the short run and increases the chances that when the economy does slow it could do so abruptly, perhaps falling into recession. A sharp slowdown would undermine corporate profits, the main prop for stock prices.",,,

Really? Well, yeah.</br></br>OK, not for the half-naked demonstrators, the ranting anti-Semites, Kanye West or anyone else who has helped make Occupy Wall Street a target for easy ridicule. But to the extent that the mainly young demonstrators have a valid complaint, it's that they are trying to bust their way into an economy where there is one job for every five job-seekers, and where youth unemployment runs north of 18%. That is a cause for frustration, if not outrage.</br></br>The question is, outrage at whom? On Wednesday, Occupy Wall Street marched on J.P. Morgan Chase's headquarters, after having protested outside CEO Jamie Dimon's home the previous day. That's odd, seeing that J.P.

Output is now 6.1% higher than it was a year earlier. The March gain, meanwhile, was revised upward to 0.7%, sharply higher than the preliminary estimate of a 0.3% increase. Taken together, the numbers suggest that U.S. industrial production continues to gain strength and that the April increase isn't a one-month anomaly.</br></br>With suppliers straining to keep up with strong consumer and business demand, the nation's capacity-utilization rate jumped 0.4% to 82.1%, the first time that the index has climbed above 82% in about two years. Utilization rates of less than 84%, however, suggest that manufacturers have enough slack to increase output without triggering production delays or bottlenecks</br></br>The report came as the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee prepared to meet here to consider a further interest-rate increase designed to slow the pace of the economy's growth while keeping inflation under wraps. The central bank has raised rates by a quarter of a percentage point five times since last June, but is widely expected to choose a more aggressive, half-point increase at its meeting today. A half-point move would bring the federal-funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend to each other overnight -- to its highest level in about nine years.</br></br>Still, yesterday's report offers some good news on the inflation front. Most of the overall increase in industrial output came about because of a 1.6% run-up in production of computers and other information-processing hardware and software. This and other technology have helped spark the massive productivity gains, which have held inflation in check in recent years. Technology production rose 2.7% in April, and is up an eye-popping 59% year over year. Consumer goods production, by comparison, increased 0.6% after being flat the last two months.",,,

The intervention is an effort to ""counteract a negative psychology that had developed in part on the false perception that the U.S. was trying to drive down the dollar for competitive reasons or that the U.S. was somehow indifferent to where market forces took the dollar,"" a senior Treasury official said yesterday. Of course, Mr. Bentsen himself contributed to all this back in February 1993, just after taking office, when he told a questioner that he would like to see a stronger yen. He has since been more careful, but other officials occasionally have reinforced the markets' impression that the administration favors a weak dollar.

There are always tradeoffs and harm from price controls, and quantitative easing has been the most ambitious and far-reaching price-control policy ever attempted. QE's massive bond purchases and money creation eroded market confidence and sidelined capital for many who attributed a phony recovery and an artificial economy to QE. Mohammed El Erian, the CEO of Pimco, the world's largest bond fund manager, points out that Fed creation of money in $4 trillion of QE bond purchases added a mere quarter of 1% (0.25%) to GDP growth -- a lousy tradeoff considering the heightened risks of inflation from QE money expansion and the risks of Fed insolvency from the attendant precipitous fall in bond prices.</br></br>In spite of the rise in asset prices of stocks and real estate from QE policies, it may turn out that far less new wealth was actually created if those prices deflate when QE liquidity is withdrawn.</br></br>QE has been accompanied by the worst post-recession recovery on record since the Great Depression in terms of GDP growth and a 40-year low in the labor-force participation rate. By maintaining interest rates at abnormally low levels, QE masks the real cost of the growing entitlement state while it also helped bailout and re-elect President Obama, resulting in a continuation of failed fiscal policies and the postponement of the day of reckoning on national debt and entitlement reform, which are essential for sustainable economic recovery.</br></br>Scott S.

The decline marks a significant reversal in borrowing, which peaked at $122.1 billion in 2010-11 after rising for years.</br></br>The drop is partly due to a decline in enrollment at for-profit colleges, where most students borrow and where default rates are generally higher. The schools have come under increased scrutiny since 2010, when a report by the Government Accountability Office found deceptive practices that ranged from promising unrealistically high pay for graduating students to not disclosing total tuition costs for students before they enrolled.</br></br>At traditional colleges, families have been cutting back on expenses, experts say.

Some of the statistics suggest that a slowdown of sorts may be under way, but this slowdown is likely to create more problems than it solves.</br></br>To begin with, it isn't much of a slowdown. The Commerce Department in its flash report last week estimated that the inflation-adjusted gross national product will rise by 5.7% in the quarter ending June 30. At the same time the department revised upward its figure for the first quarter from 8.8% to 9.7%. Going from 9.7% to 5.7% is a slowdown but not an impressive one.</br></br>The big first-quarter number stemmed largely from inventory-building by businessmen, who had been slow to recognize that an old-fashioned boom was under way. Purchases for inventory apparently have been lower in the current quarter, but little else is slowing down.</br></br>As usual, high interest rates are beginning to bite into housing. Sales of new homes have declined, and last week the Commerce Department reported that new housing starts declined 10.5% in May. Industrial production rose more slowly in May.</br></br>Otherwise, a boom seems to be rolling. Edward S. Hyman Jr., an economist at the brokerage firm of Cyrus J. Lawrence, watches a ""revisions index."" Government statistical agencies are constantly revising their numbers on the basis of late information. When the numbers steadily head upward, Mr. Hyman sees a trend toward strength. The numbers on the first-quarter gross national product, in order, were 7.2%, 8.3%, 8.8% and now 9.7%.",,,

Last year, gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic activity, grew at an inflation-adjusted 3.3%.</br></br>However, as the housing and auto slumps have deepened while business spending has started to wane, economists are taking another whack at their GDP forecasts. Earlier this month, the consensus estimate of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal called for GDP to grow about 2.3% in the first quarter, down from an estimate of 2.5% a month earlier. The forecast for the second quarter was unchanged at 2.4%.

Economists say it is has been of greater depth, and likely will have more lasting consequences, than it did during prior downturns.</br></br>In good part, that's because the soaring housing market has lifted the median price of single-family homes by 15%, making property taxes attractive to state and municipal governments facing spending increases. Meanwhile, states have grown more reluctant to lift income or sales taxes in recent years for fear of political retribution, economists say. In some cases, they are even prevented from doing so by laws passed during the 1990s boom.</br></br>""The local property tax is one tax the local [authorities] can use to offset declines in state money,"" says William Fischel, a professor of economics at Dartmouth College. ""To some extent, if the state is sending municipalities or even school districts less money because they're in fiscally difficult times, the one tax the local [authorities] have some discretion over raising is the property tax.""</br></br>Though municipalities can offset rising property values by changing their millage rates, or the rates at which taxes are levied on properties, many strapped municipalities chose not to do so in recent years.

But Clinton administration officials stressed that the long-term prospects for U.S. sales abroad remained strong.</br></br>The Commerce Department reported that the trade deficit widened from a revised $11.05 billion in May. Private analysts had expected the June deficit to be somewhat narrower than May's, based on earlier economic reports.

The positive quarterly comparison was largely due to a charge in the year- earlier period, and CEO Lee Scott didn't try to hide his disappointment in his company's latest results. ""Our underlying operating performance this quarter is not what we expect of ourselves, and not what our shareholders expect of us,"" he said in a statement. The retail giant said sluggishness in the overall economy contributed to its weaker outlook, but some of the problems are of Wal-Mart's making.

Despite another jump in energy prices, July data on U.S. wholesale prices were unlikely to stir inflation concerns. The producer price index for finished goods rose 0.6%, but the core number that excludes more volatile food and energy prices was up just 0.1% -- slightly below Wall Street expectations. Even more unexpected was Tuesday's trade data: the U.S. deficit narrowed in June due to surprising strength in exports. Growth in U.S. demand for imported goods also slowed slightly, knocking the trade gap down 1.7% to $58.14 billion. The trade deficit from May was also revised downward to $59.16 billion. Strength in the global economy at large, combined with continued weakness in the dollar, helped enhance demand for U.S. exports. Bear Stearns analysts wrote that the trade numbers will likely lead the Commerce Department to revise second-quarter economic growth around 4.3% from an originally reported 3.4%.</br></br>---",,,

While the overall CPI registered the biggest monthly jump in 31/2 years, rising 0.6%, the more closely watched core index, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, edged up 0.2%. Expectations were for a 0.5% gain in the headline number, with a 0.2% rise in core prices.</br></br>Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan threw even more cold water on speculation that U.S. rates were headed sharply higher when he played down the risk of inflation.

Thousands of workers using shovels were building a canal. Friedman was puzzled. Why weren't there any excavators or any mechanized earth-moving equipment? A government official explained that using shovels created more jobs. Friedman's response: ""Then why not use spoons instead of shovels?""</br></br>That story came to mind last week when President Obama linked technology to job losses. ""There are some structural issues with our economy where a lot of businesses have learned to become much more efficient with a lot fewer workers,"" he said. ""You see it when you go to a bank and you use an ATM, you don't go to a bank teller, or you go to the airport and you're using a kiosk instead of checking in at the gate.""</br></br>The president calls this a structural issue--we usually call it progress. And it isn't exactly a new phenomenon. It's been going on for centuries, and its pace has accelerated over the past 50 years. Businesses relentlessly look for ways to replace workers with machines. The machines get better and smarter. We go from spoons to shovels to excavators, not the other way around.</br></br>Telephone switchboard operators lose jobs to automated switching.

842617400,5,2/6/96,Golden warning,"On Jan. 31, the Federal Reserve Board announced that it was lowering the federal-funds rate and the discount rate by one-quarter of 1%. In making the move, the Fed cited the moderation in economic growth and chose to ignore the warning of gold moving above $400 an ounce. As a consequence, the markets have given the Fed a very unsatisfactory grade for its latest rate cut. In the wake of this rate cut, the price of gold has pushed higher to $415 an ounce, long-term interest rates have moved higher, the yield curve has steepened, and the dollar has slipped against the mark and the yen. In other words, interest rates on bonds went up even though the cost of borrowing money fell. Bond investors said, in effect: Pay me more interest to bribe me to own the bonds.</br></br>A rise in the price of gold is the best signal that we have to indicate that there is diminished confidence about the future purchasing-power reliability of money. The price of gold rises when the most savvy and suspicious investors believe the Fed has become a less reliable guardian of the value of our money. Or they may believe that in our democracy the president or Congress may pressure the Fed to lower interest rates. These suspicious investors would move out of dollars and into gold if they thought that the government was leaning on the Fed to lessen its commitment to price stability.</br></br>Last week's interest rate cut raises questions about whether it might have been a politically motivated deal. It was unusual that the discount rate was cut by only one-quarter of 1% -- you have to go back to 1978 to see such a small change in the discount rate -- and yet six Fed banks (including all five of the banks whose presidents have an Federal Open Market Committee vote) requested the move. Based on minutes from the Dec. 19 FOMC meeting, there were some members who would have preferred to leave rates unchanged and were unsure, after the rate cut at that meeting, what the direction of the next rate move would be. Where were their voices at the January meeting? Remember, the term of Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan runs out March 2, only eight months before the presidential election.</br></br>On Jan. 31, the Fed ignored the warning signal from the 8% rise in the price of gold above the 1995 average. The Fed effectively said that even though there is some move out of dollars into gold, it will declare inflation to be satisfactory and give another small shove toward growth. Since the discount rate announcement, the price of gold has risen $11, to $415 an ounce; 30-year bonds have fallen two points in price, taking the yield up to 6.17% despite economic data that ought to have been favorable for bonds; and the dollar has fallen two yen, to 105 yen. Why was the immediate response to this monetary policy change so adverse?</br></br>1. The rise in the price of gold was ignored by the Fed. Standing pat or doing nothing could have achieved a great deal. The Fed could have demonstrated its concern by leaving the funds rate unchanged at 5.5%. If the Fed had not ignored the signal, the suspicions that led to a preference for gold probably would have abated.",,,

Some people, including this newspaper's David Wessel in a column last week, believe the great Nobel laureate would favor this inflationary program. I am certain he would not.</br></br>Friedman's main message for central banks was to maintain a monetary rule that kept the growth of the money supply constant. In his Newsweek column, ""Inflation and Jobs"" (Nov. 12, 1979), for example, Friedman emphasized that ""unemployment is . . . a side effect of the cure for inflation,"" so that if a central bank ""cured"" unemployment by inflating, it ""will have unemployment later.""

If this feels like a 180-degree turn from August, it basically is. It would be one thing if this were a special case, or a broad turning point. But these jerky swings have become the norm. Consider what has happened so far this year: Real gross domestic product shrank in January and February, according to tracking firm Macroeconomic Advisers. Then it surged more than 1% in March. It contracted again in May and June -- only to jump more than 1% again in July.</br></br>This isn't typical. Since 1992, monthly GDP has fallen about a third of the time when the economy hasn't been in recession. This year, even assuming a small gain in August, monthly GDP has fallen about half the time.

Spanish is spoken in a quarter of all homes, and 38 percent of adults are foreign born.</br></br>Los Angeles, McClintock says, grew ""like the old Soviet Union,"" by ""gobbling up"" contiguous communities, such as Hollywood and many others. It used its ownership of water rights to lure communities into an imperial city.</br></br>The result is a city of 467 square miles, large enough to hold St. Louis, Milwaukee, Cleveland, Minneapolis, San Francisco, Boston and Pittsburgh, with room remaining for Manhattan.

830982098,3,1/12/71,The Heavy Cost of Continued Inflation,"Regardless of any mitigating qualifications that may be read into it, the unemployment of 6 per cent of the national labor force in December is a sobering commentary on the economic transition through which the United States is passing. Undoubtedly it does reflect in part the winding down of the war in Vietnam. In larger measure it is a product of the economic slowdown deliberately brought about to curb an alarming rise in inflation. The specific cause in any particular case will not lessen the distress of jobless families, however, and that distress is now sufficiently widespread to make corrective measures imperative.</br></br>The classical method of dealing with inflation has always had an ironic twist. The curtailment of economic activity to relieve the upward pressure on prices has exacted sacrifices from those least able to bear them. This time, moreover, the irony has multiplied. While 4.6 million unemployed are tightening their belts because of the scarcity of jobs, millions of other workers are taking advantage of the continued inflation to boost their incomes, with little or no regard for what the general consequences may be.</br></br>In addition to this special toll exacted from people who lose their jobs, the economic trends of the last year have been rough on a large majority of wage earners. Hourly pay has advanced over the last year by 5.8 per cent, but the cost of living in November was 5.6 per cent above the figure a year ago. In other words, almost the entire increase was eaten up by higher prices, with no allowance for the rise in worker productivity, which is now increasing again.</br></br>last year. Department of Labor statistics for the first nine months of 1970, the latest available, show ���a mean wage and benefit package adjustment of 10 per cent a year.�۝ The average first-year wage and benefit change during that same period amounted to 14.7 per cent a year. Economists recognize these exorbitant wage increases in some key industries as a leading cause of continued inflation even in the face of lax economic activity.</br></br>One segment of labor, the unemployed, is taking a severe drubbing from the current economic situation while another, the large powerful unions, is riding the crest of excessive benefits for its own members. The sacrifice imposed on workers at the bottom of the scale for the sake of attaining a stable economy is proving to be ineffective in part because of the extraordinary power exerted by other labor groups at the top of the scale.",,,

Barbera, chief economist at ITG-Hoenig, wrote in a report to clients over the weekend. ""Most obviously, a slower trajectory for global growth now seems unavoidable. . . . U.S. consumer spending will take a hit in the months ahead.""</br></br>Several Wall Street firms reduced their predictions for U.S. economic growth in the second half of the year, citing the impact of gas prices on consumer spending and the disruption of commodity shipments through the critical ports at the mouth of the Mississippi. Credit Suisse First Boston, for instance, reduced its estimated gross domestic product growth for the third quarter from 3.7 percent to 3 percent.</br></br>William C. Dudley, chief U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs & Co., wrote in a research note that the reduction in economic output should be limited to the next few months.

830982233,3,11/21/90,What We Could Learn From Mexico,"The sad spectacle of the U.S. political leadership's fruitless negotiations over the past several months - or is it years now? - to reduce the country's increasingly hard-to-finance budget deficit has prompted some observers to talk about the ""Latinamericanization"" of the U.S. economy. They refer, presumably, to Latin America's unhappy experience for almost a decade with huge external debt, large budget deficits fueled by too much spending and too few taxes, and closed economies protecting inefficient local industry. Indeed, this characterization of the U.S. economy seems uncomfortably apt.</br></br>However, at least one Latin American country stands out as a model of economic modernization, and the United States would do well to emulate its commitment to budget and tax reform. Mexico - yes, Mexico - has demonstrated greater courage, foresight and political will to tackle its economic problems than has its more powerful neighbor to the north. And it is now beginning to enjoy the fruits of those endeavors.</br></br>Obviously the countries are vastly different in terms of their economic power. Nevertheless, they share startlingly similar problems, which Mexico has done a better job of solving. After a long spending spree, Mexico's budget deficit soared to 18 percent of gross domestic product by 1982. Through a combination of gut-wrenching cuts in spending and far-reaching tax reform, Mexico's budget today is essentially in balance. Mexico delights in pointing out, accurately, that it has put into effect the equivalent of three Gramm-Rudmans. Would that our government could achieve even one.</br></br>The United States runs chronic trade deficits, and protectionist sentiment, especially in Congress, is strong. The most recent manifestation, coming on the heels of many others, is the textile bill. Though vetoed by the president, it reflects a political consensus in this country that certain sectors, both industrial and agricultural, still need to be protected. Compared with a decade ago, restraints on U.S. imports have doubled. At least 20 percent of U.S. imports are limited by some form of non-tariff barrier, thus not only depriving the consumer of cheaper imports but also subsidizing noncompetitive industry.</br></br>Mexico, on the other hand, has dramatically reduced import barriers, transforming itself from one of the most closed economies in the world to one of the most open. Non-oil exports have quadrupled, and Mexico has become a world-class producer of automobiles, automotive parts, televisions, computer chips and satellite and aircraft components.",,,

Faced with the need to cut the federal deficit and deal with falling farm income, Congress is pursuing the easiest and least defensible solution. It�۪s asking American consumers to pay more for food, and the burden will fall disproportionately on the poor and hungry. In 1981 and 1982, Congress cut over $3 billion from food assistance programs. Now it is voting to raise supermarket prices for milk, cheese, meat and bread.</br></br>For almost 50 years the federal government has attempted to increase farm income through a combination of programs that limit production and drive food prices up or that make direct payments to farmers when farm prices fall below a certain level. Direct payments tend to have less impact on retail food prices, but they can cost the taxpayer a lot of money. Therefore, it isn�۪t surprising that, in a time of huge budget deficits, a growing farm crisis and relatively stable food prices. Congress is tempted to adopt a farm program that shifts costs from the citizen as taxpayer to the citizen as consumer.</br></br>The House has already succumbed. It approved a dairy diversion program that will raise millc and cheese prices by $10 billion over the next four years and a sugar program that will cost consumers $140 million to $160 million a year. It is about to vote on a program of mandatory production controls on feed grains and wheat that would raise meat and bakery product prices by $15 billion over a four-year period and could raise the consumer price index for food by 1 percent a year.</br></br>Production-control advocates argue that food prices have been quite stable over the past few years, that Americans spend less of their disposable income for food than consumers in other developed nations and that the anticipated food-price increases generated by the farm bill are a reasonable trade-off for preserving the family farm.</br></br>They aren�۪t all wrong.

Our old zero-sum assumptions - profits and productivity versus the birds and the trees - have given way to a new understanding of the relationships between economics and ecology. ""Doing well"" is increasingly being associated with ""doing good"" for the earth. Conservation is no longer being seen as an inhibitor to growth, but as a stimulus for efficiency. Environmental responsibility is no longer some corporate feel-good issue, but an obligation - to customers, investors, employees, communities and others. To that extent, the notion of ""greener"" companies can be a win-win proposition, with salutary effects for both business and the earth.</br></br>That's an underlying message from Frances Cairncross, who argues in Costing the Earth that the partnership of clear-sighted economic policies and resourceful companies can survive, even thrive, in the new era of global environmental concern.</br></br>As environmental editor for the British magazine the Economist, Cairncross has a perspective rooted firmly on the east side of the Atlantic Ocean, where ""government regulation"" hasn't yet earned the same public scorn as ""acid rain."" Her desire to see taxes and regulations realign market signals so as to favor cleaner, greener products and processes is a laudable goal, to be sure, but it may be more at home in the current political climate of Munich, than in Marietta, Ga. Her belief that consumers and producers should pay the true costs of the environmental damage they cause is another worthy ideal, but of dubious practicality in a climate where federal regulators are prone to tiptoe through living rooms and boardrooms, leaving the fewest possible footprints in both.",,,

830982704,8,8/18/93,The `Reagan Revolution',"The Reagan Revolution isn't and never was. Yet it remains a standard reference point in Washington political analysis and reporting. Its invention and survival illustrate just how mediocre much political journalism is: simplistic, lacking in historical perspective and often wrong. The first job of journalism is to ""get it right"" - to be accurate. All too often, political reporting doesn't. It amounts to mythmaking.</br></br>I take as my text for this grumpy thesis two recent articles in powerful publications. Both try to explain President Clinton's troubles and successes in terms of the alleged Reagan Revolution. Both exemplify persisting sins of political journalism, which is often a triumph of slogans over facts. Politics is viewed, as James Reston often wrote, as sport. The object of reporting is to explain who wins, who loses, why and what it means.</br></br>The trouble is that politics is not just a game - a series of electoral and legislative contests - but also an expression of national habits and values. Unless these are understood, politics can't be adequately reported. Much political commentary ignores this larger context. Consider a front-page ""news analysis"" in the New York Times on Aug. 1. Titled ""Reagan's Curse on Clinton,"" it attributed Clinton's difficulty in passing his budget to ""the Presidency of Ronald Reagan and the political climate he created.""</br></br>Wrote R. W. Apple Jr., the Times' Washington bureau chief: ""Mr. Reagan successfully argued that government itself was the problem. Most federal programs were bad; taxes were bad; spending was bad... . {The result is that} politicians are terrified to wear that awful label, `tax and spend,' however much their constituents need government money for health care or roads.""</br></br>Every trend or change must be credited to or blamed on somebody. What's missed are deeper currents in American thinking and society. Reagan didn't create the mood that Apple describes. Americans have always been suspicious of concentrated power, and national government is - for better or worse - now our most powerful institution. Even in 1958, 43 percent of Americans felt that the federal government ""wasted a lot"" of money.",,,

Are there costs associated with refinancing? Is there a formula that tells us whether refinancing makes sense?</br></br>A In recent years, many homeowners have made refinancing almost an annual ritual. Interest rates, which are near an all-time low, have been steadily dropping, and consumers have taken advantage of these lower rates.</br></br>There are some costs, though, just as there were when you obtained your original mortgage. The only differences between a purchase and a refinance are that there is no buyer or seller present at closing, and no real estate broker is involved.</br></br>Your refinance lender, even if it is the same lender who holds your current loan, has to start from scratch. The lender must obtain current financial information about you, contract for an updated appraisal of the property and receive an updated title report. Just because everything was acceptable several years ago when you obtained your mortgage does not mean that everything is acceptable today.</br></br>You should shop around.

830982917,5,11/7/07,Recession's Hidden Virtues,"We are all waiting, it seems, for the next recession. Everyone knows that the business cycle hasn't been repealed, and so another recession is inevitable. Some indicators suggest that it might be sooner rather than later. The Conference Board's consumer confidence index has declined for three straight months. In March, 30 percent of respondents said jobs are ""plentiful""; now that's only 24 percent. All this inspires much foreboding, because a recession is widely regarded as a calamity or something close to it.</br></br>Just last week, the Federal Reserve cut its key overnight interest rate for the second time since August. It now stands at 4.5 percent, down from its recent peak of 5.25 percent. Although the economy grew at a strong 3.9 percent annual rate in the third quarter, most economists regard this as an aberration. They expect slower growth or a recession, because three powerful forces are assaulting the economic expansion.</br></br>First, housing. Its collapse deepens. Economist Richard Berner of Morgan Stanley notes that sales of new and existing homes have dropped 42 percent and 30 percent, respectively, from their peaks of more than two years ago. As supplies of unsold homes grow, real estate prices continue to fall. One index finds that prices in August were down 4.4 percent nationally from a year earlier.</br></br>Second, oil prices. They're approaching $100 a barrel. Even before the latest price increases, energy costs rose to 6.2 percent of consumer spending in the second quarter; that's up from 4.5 percent in 2002, notes consultant Jack Lavery, a former chief economist of Merrill Lynch. Higher energy costs will continue to weaken purchasing power for other goods and services, he says.</br></br>Third, credit problems. As lenders and investors have suffered losses on subprime mortgages -- loans to weaker borrowers -- they've tightened lending standards for other borrowers. With the economy slowing, Diane Vazza of Standard & Poor's expects bond defaults to rise among shakier corporate borrowers, especially companies dependent on strong consumer spending (retailers, fast-food chains, entertainment firms).",,,

830983226,2,4/24/09,Break Up the Banks,"Our leading financial institutions announced that they had actually made a profit in the year's first quarter through the creative manipulation of rules and regulations, lobbied Congress to preserve their ability to raise credit card interest rates just for the heck of it and opposed the administration's plan for restructuring Chrysler, which would save some jobs and honor pension obligations, in the hope that they can redeem the company's bonds at a higher level than they're trading at just now. And, to round out the picture, the Wall Street Journal reported this week that lending at the 19 largest TARP recipients was 23 percent lower in February -- by which time these banks had received hundreds of billions of dollars in public funds intended to enable them to lend more -- than it had been in October, before the floodgates of tax dollars had been fully opened.</br></br>The week began with a burst of creative accounting. Citigroup, into which we've sunk more dough than any other company, with the possible exception of AIG, claimed a profit for the first quarter of this year because its bonded debt has lost value, which under the rules of accountancy enabled it to register a one-time gain equal to that lost value, because Citi could, in theory, buy back its own bonds for less. J.P. Morgan Chase, whose fire-sale purchase of Bear Stearns we taxpayers backed, declared a similar profit because of a similar decline in the value of its bonds.</br></br>As events would have it, the very same Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase are the lead negotiators for the banks that are objecting to the Obama administration's efforts to restructure Chrysler. Chrysler's bonds, which these banks hold, are trading at 15 cents on the dollar, the amount the government offered to pay the banks in its initial proposal to restore the company to viability. Yesterday, the government upped that amount to 22 cents, plus a 5 percent equity share in the company. Citigroup and J.P. Morgan Chase, however, insist that they and their fellow banks are entitled to more, though that ""more"" could only come at the expense of Fiat (the auto company that is providing the new car lines and technology without which Chrysler will fold) or the company's retirees (to whose health-care fund Chrysler is legally obligated) who built the company, or the taxpayers who are keeping Chrysler alive.</br></br>Instead of playing Scrooge (and a publicly subsidized Scrooge, at that), what the banks should do is lend Chrysler their accountants. Maybe they'd show that the company turned a profit last year.</br></br>The banks' lobbyists, meanwhile, have been hard at work, too. Bills to limit credit card fees and penalties -- my favorite fee is the one banks charge some customers for making (not missing, making) a payment -- are moving through both houses of Congress, but the Senate version has yet to receive any support from Republicans.

Weidenbaum, Reagan�۪s chief economist, recently said that even the $56 billion worth of spending cuts and revenue-raising measures proposed in the president�۪s February budget are not regarded as large enough to relieve pressures in financial markets and bring interest rates down.

To show the dimensions of these investments, principally American, between October 1955 and March 1957, net direct investments amounted to Canadian S639 million; net new security issues amounted to Canadian $701 million; trade in outstanding securities amounted to Canadian $300 million; other capital flows amounted to Canadian $390 million. Also, Canada increased its official holdings of gold and U. S. dollars by Canadian $16 million.</br></br>Canada, which resembles the movement of European money into the United States subsequent to the Civil War, came from the United States.</br></br>. . After the Korean boom, there were significant tax reductions for fiscal years 1953-54 and 1955-56. The tax reductions for 1953-54 consisted mainly in eliminating a surchai�۪ge' on individual income taxes and a reduction in the corporate profits tax. Similar but small reductions characterized the rate changes for 1955-56, introduced when the extent and timing of the economic recovery was still unknown. For 1957-58, there were smaller cuts in indirect taxes, reducing aggregate tax revenues by about 1 per cent and still leaving an increased budget surplus.�۝",,,

830983363,4,1/7/92,Off Welfare and on to Work,"Squeezed by the recession, states are under great pressure to cut spending, and many have responded in part by reducing or proposing to reduce welfare benefits. This movement threatens to obscure the nascent effort, just entering its third year, to help mothers break their complete dependency on welfare through work. It is an effort that could also save money, though that isn�۪t its major purpose.</br></br>Because welfare developments don�۪t get much public attention, many people may have missed or forgotten the striking series of changes in federal policy designed to reduce welfare rolls by encouraging work.</br></br>The seminal legislation was the bipartisan Family Support Act of 1988. This legislation provided states with several billion dollars over five years to pay for education, training, child care and other services intended to help mothers leave welfare for work���including one year of health benefits and day care after leaving welfare.</br></br>Congress and Presidents Reagan and Bush have collaborated on several other pieces of legislation designed to help promote work. The 1986 tax reform bill eliminated or dramatically reduced federal taxes for low-income workers. The bill also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, an earnings subsidy paid by the federal government to low-income working families with children. In 1990 Congress and President Bush expanded the EITC even more. By 1994, many working families will be eligible for up to $2,400 in cash wage supplements.</br></br>We have also strengthened the nation�۪s child support enforcement program, expanded federal support for day care and broadened government support for health insurance, all on a bipartisan basis.",,,

Meanwhile, the announcement had an immediate impact on some types of securities that mature in December or January. In one instance, the interest rate on a type of contract committing someone to make money available in December fell by more than a quarter of a percentage point, which underscored the level of apprehension in the market.</br></br>""This is a doozy,"" said F. Ward McCarthy of Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a financial-markets research firm.

830983376,3,10/22/89,Bad-News Poverty Figures,"THE POLITICIANS pay too little attention; the 1988 income and poverty figures just issued by the Census Bureau are bad news.</br></br>The longest sustained economic expansion in peacetime history has failed to drive the poverty rate back to the lows of the 1970s; the economy famous for lifting all boats no longer does so. Real per capita income was up, but this broadest measure of economic well-being is an average. As in other recent years, for the richest two-fifths of families median income and income share rose; for the poorest two-fifths they declined. The gap between rich and poor was the highest in the 40-odd years it has been measured.</br></br>The poverty rate was 13.1 percent, more than one American in eight, down only 0.3 percent from the year before. The bureau called that steady. For children, who made up 40 percent of the poor, the rate was 19.7 percent, the highest of any age group; for blacks, 31.6 percent; black children, 44.6 percent; Hispanics and Hispanic children, 26.8 percent and 37.9 percent. For the elderly it was 12 percent, lower than for the population as a whole.</br></br>Weak wages are one of the reasons the economy no longer functions as it used to. In real terms the earnings of men working full-time year-round declined last year, while those of women were flat. Median family income was also flat for the first time since the recovery began in 1982. When married couples gain ground, it is often because both wife and husband work, but not even steady work is enough to save all families. A sixth of poor families last year were headed by people, mostly men, who worked full-time year-round.</br></br>The policy implications of these figures are as obvious as they are resisted. The need is not to cut the capital gains tax, but to raise the minimum wage, to liberalize the earned-income tax credit for the working poor with children, and perhaps also to make the existing child care credit refundable and available to those too poor to owe any taxes. All four of these proposals are before Congress. Rejecting the first while enacting the others would move money from people who most emphatically do not need it to others who do.",,,

Ehrlich Jr. is betting that anxiety about the faltering economic recovery and discontent with the status quo will penetrate even a left-leaning jurisdiction that is home to more federal workers than any other in the state.</br></br>Ehrlich, who plans to campaign again in Montgomery on Tuesday, has mapped a strategy that in part seeks to win votes in the western and northern parts of the county, which are more conservative than the communities that hug the Capital Beltway. He hopes a message of lower taxes and a friendlier business climate will sell in a county that has an increasingly diversified private sector.</br></br>""This is the type of election cycle where Democrats are more willing to cross party lines,"" Ehrlich said as he took a break recently from greeting seniors arriving at the county fair in Gaithersburg. ""We think the low 40s is doable here.""</br></br>That might not sound terribly ambitious, but in Maryland's largest county even a modest uptick in Ehrlich's support could add thousands of votes to his statewide total in what is shaping up as a competitive rematch against Gov.

It assumes that voters are ready to forgive President Reagan for his ill-conceived Economic Recovery Program, that supply-side fantasy that sent the economy into a tailspin, idling 33 percent of the nation�۪s productive capacity, driving unemployment up to 12 million, creating over $400 billion in deficits, boosting mortgage interest to 18 percent and, in the process, forcing cutbacks in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment compensation.</br></br>That sort of polity, and the pall it cast over the economy until last summer, are not so quickly forgotten. The way Democrats can keep the issue alive is by pointing to the next four years. Long after the need for a shift in economic policy became imperative, Reagan was the one who insisted on ���staying the course.�۝ So it is almost certain that, at the first sign of renewed inflation, a second Reagan administration would send the average American through the economic wringer again. All of those who lost their jobs before would be out on the street again.</br></br>If this does not have the makings of an effective election issue, I don�۪t know one when I see it.

830983776,3,1/26/00,The Biggest Boom Ever,"We are about to rewrite history. Unless a recession begins in the next few days, this boom will soon become the longest in the American experience. In February, it will have lasted 107 months. The current record is 106 months between February 1961 and December 1969, according to the dating of business cycles by the National Bureau of Economic Research. By and large, Americans are behaving as if recessions are a relic of the past, even though everyone must realize that the boom will end someday--and might end badly.</br></br>As with all records, people will celebrate and assert bragging rights. President Clinton always claims credit and will almost certainly repeat the claims in tomorrow's State of the Union. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is idolized for his presumed role. The murkier truth is that the boom's causes remain obscure and, to the extent they can be identified, reflect a protracted and largely nonpolitical process.</br></br>Low inflation has been the critical catalyst. In the past, rising inflation has doomed expansions through higher interest rates, increased labor costs and squeezed profits. Consumer spending, housing construction and business investment all suffered. Yet, inflation now remains tame. By various measures, it's running between 1 percent and slightly more than 2 percent a year. This is lower than in 1990 (between 4 percent and 6 percent by the same measures) and defies the conventional tendency of inflation to worsen as the economy ""heats up."" * The Fed: Paul Volcker, chairman of the Fed between 1979 and 1987, crushed inflationary expectations. In the 1960s and 1970s, these had become ingrained. Companies raised prices because they expected customers would pay. Workers expected pay raises to compensate for higher prices--and then some. The Fed blessed the process by creating more money. Its permissive policies rested on the prevailing--but faulty--theory that a bit of inflation aided economic growth. By 1980 inflation had reached double digits. Volcker tightened money, increased interest rates and caused a savage recession. In 1982 unemployment neared 11 percent. Though brutal, the downturn stifled wage and price increases. By 1983 inflation was 4 percent. President Reagan sanctioned Volcker's policy by muting criticism. Since then, Greenspan's Fed has pursued ""price stability"" and has raised interest rates (as in 1994) to prevent inflation's upward creep. Presidents Bush and Clinton have emulated Reagan's self- restraint.</br></br>* Better Management: Through the 1970s, corporate managers were rarely fired. Their job tenure rivaled university professors'. In the 1980s, things changed. Managers became vulnerable to job loss for many reasons: the recession; foreign competition; deregulation in the airline, trucking and communications industries; ""hostile"" corporate takeovers; the growth of new discounters (Wal-Mart, Home Depot). Self- preservation made managers more ruthless. They cut costs to raise profits. Old plants were shut. Layoffs and ""downsizings"" became common. Again, the immediate consequences were often cruel and (as with Volcker's recession) widely deplored. But the lasting effect was less inflationary behavior.</br></br>* New Technology: As everyone knows, business investment in computers and communications has exploded. The presumption is that these investments enable companies to do things faster and cheaper-- they raise ""productivity."" Firms can minimize unneeded inventories or speed the processing of customer orders. Higher productivity can be magical. If a company improves productivity 3 percent, it can raise wages 3 percent without increasing prices or sacrificing profits. And productivity has improved. In recent years, it's approached 3 percent a year, up from 1.6 percent in the 1980s.",,,

830983923,3,4/12/89,The Case for A Recession,"Economist Bill Helming runs a small consulting service in Shawnee Mission, Kans. His clients include major food companies, banks, supermarket chains, feed-lot operators and farmers. Of 80 economists surveyed recently by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators-a newsletter that follows economic forecasts-Helming is the gloomiest. He's predicting recession. In 1990, unemployment would average 6.5 percent, up from March's 5 percent. And the economy's output of goods and services (gross national product) would drop 1.5 percent.</br></br>What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation. Chances are you won't read that elsewhere. In polite society, almost no one admits that recessions are inevitable and sometimes desirable. What's unmentionable, though, happens to be true. Outside of wartime-when people may tolerate wage and price controls-periodic recessions have been the only practical way of containing inflation. It's a truth worth remembering as the 1980s' economic expansion (now in its seventh year) enters its final stages.</br></br>There are multiplying signs of strains. By every indicator (consumer prices, producer prices and labor costs), inflation is increasing. Since last spring the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates more than 3 percentage points. Although unemployment remains low, some of the zip is going out of the economy. Auto sales are dropping. Home buying is declining and increases in retail sales have been small. But the Fed does not say for a moment that it's trying to engineer a recession, and few private economists dare predict one.</br></br>Analysts like Helming are the exceptions. The typical forecaster anticipates a relatively harmless slowdown. Of the forecasts regularly followed by the ""blue chip"" newsletter, the average calls for economic growth (the increase in GNP) of 2.7 percent in 1989 and 1.7 percent in 1990, compared with 3.9 percent in 1988. This is what the Fed says it wants: in the""What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation."" current jargon, a ""soft landing"" that will somehow disarm inflation.</br></br>On paper, the strategy could work. In practice, the odds are against it. The process by which inflation relents is no great mystery. Higher unemployment relieves pressures for steeper wage increases. Excess inventories, idle factory capacity and ample supplies of commodities (such as grains, metals and chemicals) weaken price pressures. If slower growth doesn't produce these conditions, inflation almost certainly won't abate. It could get worse. That's the danger, because both consumer prices and labor costs are already advancing at a rate of about 5 percent annually.",,,
830983937,5,5/26/74,A Tax Escape for the Few: A Tax Escape for the Few,"In the past year, a group of individuals interested in investment banking and the stock market, with the aid of Washington legal advisers, has been quietly pushing a proposal to reduce the tax on capital gains.</br></br>A Senate finance subcommittee already has held little-publicized hearings on the proposal, and it is now being promoted before the House Ways and Means Committee as a ���tax reform.�۝</br></br>The essence of this proposal is that the proportion of a capital gain included in taxable income���which now is only 50 per cent, of the gain���should he reduced still further. The proposed reduction would be in steps of 2 per cent a year for each year the asset is hold, up to 15 years. Thus, for stock held for 15 years, only 20 per cent of the gain on its sale would be taxable.</br></br>For the wealthiest individuals, those in the 70 per cent lop tax bracket, this proposal would thus reduce their tax on the gain from 35 per cent (70 per cent of 50 per cent of the gain) to only 14 per cent (70 per cent of 20 per cent of the gain). Ironically, 14 per cent is also precisely the rate of tax applicable to the wages of the poorest taxpayers in the country.</br></br>Any reduction in the capital gains tax on the sale of stock or other capital assets will primarily benefit high-income families. Recent statistics of income indicate that individuals and families with incomes above $25,000��� about 3 per cent of all lax returns���account for around 55 per cent of all capital gains.

Pete Wilson's prescription to pound away on crime, immigration and affirmative action, they campaigned the state long and hard, but Dole and Kemp have not been able to shake Clinton's grip on this richest electoral prize. Clinton has benefited from an economic recovery that -- in California at least -- was not visible before he became president, a cultural affinity for Hollywood and the pleasure-seekers up and down the coast, and four years of careful ministration to California needs, whether it be earthquake relief or a bailout of a flat-broke hospital system. Two public polls last week put Clinton 12 to 18 points up and he was confident enough of having put it away that he cut short his final swing to work in other states.</br></br>A dozen House seats are in play, slightly more of them Republican, but in the end there may be few changes. Most prominent on the endangered species list is 16-term Rep. George Brown (D), a perennial target who this year faces an even tougher opponent in Superior Court Judge Linda Wilde (R). Brown, 76, did not help his chances when he remarked in a debate on education: ""I imagine Linda, because she is a lady, is afraid of math."" He is still trying to dig himself out of that one.</br></br>Two other Democrats have serious challenges from the same opponents who came close to defeating them in 1994. Rep. Jane Harman (D) was taken into a recount by Susan Brooks (R), a local government official in Rancho Palos Verdes. Harman has a limitless bank account and is probably strong enough to stave off Brooks again. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Vic Fazio is in a rematch with real estate broker Tim LeFever (R), who came within 7,000 votes last time. LeFever was one of the Republicans who used an ad on the death penalty in which he morphed his opponent's face into that of Richard Allen Davis, murderer of Polly Klaas.</br></br>Rep.

830984349,7,3/14/94,The Elder Share,"ONE OF the great feats of social engineering in the last 25 years has been a huge increase in the standard of living of the elderly. Social Security and Medicare have been the means. The elderly had a poverty rate of 25 percent in the late 1960s. It is half that now, and lower than the rate for the society as a whole, thanks mainly to increased Social Security benefits. In addition, thanks to Medicare, the elderly are now the group in society with the most comprehensive health insurance.</br></br>The problem with these programs is not the benefits they confer, but the cost. They have come to dominate, if not the government itself, most certainly its budget. Aiding the elderly is now the main thing that the federal government does; such aid accounts for fully half the budget for other than interest on the debt and defense. The share can only rise as the baby boomers retire in the years ahead - but the money to support such an expansion is not in sight.</br></br>The taxes presently in place won't cover projected Social Security costs when the boomers retire early in the next century. The Medicare trust fund will be exhausted even earlier. To protect the long-term integrity of both, Congress will sooner or later have to raise taxes or cut costs; if costs, it ought to begin a gradual process now.</br></br>The trust funds are one source of pressure on the elder-programs; the other is the budget deficit. The president and Congress took a welcome step toward reducing it last year; they need to do more. A favorite target of budget-cutters is the spending category called entitlements. Their semi-automatic growth each year is taken as proof of the indiscipline the budget-cutters mean to cure. Which is fine, but it, too, is a euphemism. Entitlements turn out to be 60 percent aid to the elderly by another name. Congress keeps threatening to impose entitlement caps in the abstract, and now there is also an entitlements commission. But entitlement-cutting is mainly a way of discussing in general and in code a subject that the politicians would do better to discuss directly.</br></br>Thus a leading budget-cutting proposal now making the rounds is to cut the cost of entitlements across the board by means-testing them. Among the proponents is the budget-balancing group called the Concord Coalition. The idea is that a hard-pressed government has no business paying benefits (or asking middle-income taxpayers to finance benefits) for people above certain income cutoffs. For recipients with incomes above, say, $40,000 a year, entitlements (including Social Security benefits and the insurance value of Medicare) would be progressively reduced, though never wiped out entirely.",,,

However, the timing of last week�۪s decision to reduce the Federal Reserve discount rate carried considerable significance.</br></br>The weekly Dorsey statements of the banks in principal cities have made it clear that the demand by business for bank loans has been quite sluggish in the past few months, after making allowance for the usual seasonal tendencies of the late summer and autumn. But there has been a continued demand for funds in the capital markets. Consequently, interest rates have been only slightly below the recent highs ��� which have been around the highest rates in over 20 years.</br></br>The latest rate for new 91-day Treasury Bills was about 3.47 per cent, only slightly below the then prevailing discount rate of 3.5 per cent and well above the new discount rate of 3 per cent. Jn theory, the new condition would seem to encourage member banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve Banks at 3 per cent and use the funds to buy bills at 3.45 per cent, which would, of course, tend to expand bank credit.</br></br>A reduction of the discount rate below the bill rate is a most unusual development, in fact, I cannot find a duplication of it in the record of the past 25 years.</br></br>THE MOVE is all the more startling because public remarks made by FRB Chairman Martin only about two w'eeks ago were bluntly in defense of the tight credit policy, and his observations then would seem to justify the public�۪s interpretation that the tight credit policy was likely to continue.",,,

This week, as they have done in the past, the regional board members agreed to allow Mr. Reuter to borrow money to pay Metro's bills��� including its payroll���until the District government pays its full, agreed-upon share, plus interest.</br></br>If that doesn�۪t happen, the options Mr. Reuter is considering are shutting down night and weekend bus service in the District; eliminating any bus routes that duplicate rail routes; ending discount fares for schoolchildren; raising the fares for the elderly and disabled from 30 cents to 50 cents; and increasing special 35-cent fares on Anacostia buses to 60 cents.</br></br>Some of these economies may have to be made �ۢ even if the city pays its current bill, given the staggering budget problems already confronting a government in transition and under strict congressional orders. But mass transit in the city is not a designated charity for suburban taxpayers. There is enough friction within the partnership already, with participating governments re-- placing Metro bys service on certain routes with V�ۢ buses run by Tither operators. While this may yield some savings for the individual governments, it tends to raise overhead costs for the remaining regional bus and rail services.</br></br>���	Northern Virginia: The Great Disney Wars have led some officials in Virginia to ask Gov.

The total still represents less than a 5 percent increase. No one likes to pay higher taxes, but these amounts won't impoverish most Americans or cripple the economy.</br></br>How will we get hit? Higher ""sin"" taxes on cigarettes, beer and liquor seem likely. So are steeper ""user fees"" for, say, airline passengers. The impulse of Democrats and Republicans alike is to construct a package of many small-and highly technical-increases so that no one sees much impact. The budget summit should do better than that.</br></br>It should not just raise taxes but should do so in a way that makes the overall federal tax system fairer and more efficient. How about a ""carbon tax"": a tax on oil, natural gas and coal? This would depress energy use, air pollution and emissions that contribute to the ""greenhouse effect."" How about taxing capital gains (the profits on the sales of stock or other assets) when people die? Closing this loophole, which benefits mainly the wealthy, could raise at least $2 billion to $3 billion a year.</br></br>As they go about this political drudgery, the White House and Congress should adhere to three guidelines:</br></br>First, keep income-tax rates low. A tax system with high rates and many special tax breaks (credits, deductions, income exclusions) invites abuse and waste. Hordes of tax lawyers and accountants are deployed to help people and companies minimize their taxes. Investment decisions are skewed by tax breaks.

Usually, the bond encounters strong market resistance in moving below 8 percent.</br></br>Why has it been difficult for the long bond to move down through 8 percent, and what will it take for long rates to fall to the low levels of 1987? The answers hinge on inflation and the recovery.</br></br>We have to go back to the first quarter of 1987 to find yields at those low levels, prior to the three recent instances. At that time, the bond traded at 7.27 percent to 7.88 percent, with the lower yields occurring in January 1987. Then, as the economy began to improve and inflation began to rise, rates rose until Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 508 points.</br></br>Inflation is the first part of the answer. The consumer price index, a widely followed measure of inflation, rose a mere 1.1 percent from December 1985 to December 1986, helped by a 30.7 percent decline in energy costs. The CPI was up only 3.8 percent the previous year.</br></br>As a result of two good inflation years back to back, interest rates began to trend lower in February 1986, touching briefly at 7.16 percent in July, and then ambulating between 7.16 percent and 7.77 percent before closing the year at 7.33 percent.

Initially, an economic rebound was anticipated, but when one failed to develop, the Fed responded with dramatic cuts in short-term ���administered�۝ rates���the discount rate and the federal funds rate���which the Fed directly controls.</br></br>As a result of these cuts, two-thirds or more of the decline in the short rates occurred in the second half of the year, with most of that decline occurring in November and December. Consequently, the yield curve, as measured from either short rates or from the two-year note out to the 30-year bond, widened to record levels. For example, the Treasury yield curve (two-year note to the 30-year bond) began the year at a spread of -1-102 basis points and closed at +266 basis points. At midyear, the curve was only +146 and by December had widened to a high of +276 basis points.</br></br>However, since the deficit continues to grow, the overall interest cost of the debt continued to rise. To be more correct on this point, if interest rates had not declined so much, and the curve had not taken on such a positive shape, the interest cost for financing the debt would have been probably as much as one-third higher.</br></br>Another feature of last year�۪s market was its ability to finance such a huge amount of debt at such modest interest rates. True, the anemic economy and the Fed helped a great deal, but when one considers the volume of financing, it is quite incredible.",,,
830985027,4,12/20/78,"Meanwhile, Back Home ...","NOT ALL OF THE inflation in this country is coming in from the Persian Gulf, and not all of it is imposed by OPEC. After the recent attention to the increases in oil prices, and their contribution to the probability of a recession, it�۪s useful to take a look at the prices of another basic commodity, steel. OPEC has held oil prices steady this year but, as you doubtless saw, intends to raise them 14.5 percent in the coming year. By an instructive coincidence, 14.5 percent is just about the average increase in steel prices over the past year, and there is more to come in January.</br></br>This disproportionately fast run-up in steel prices is the result���unintentional, but real���of the Carter administration�۪s attempts to protect the U.S. steel industry from its foreign competitors. The American producers had been complaining that the foreign mills were selling steel here below cost, to avoid unemployment at home. That's called dumping, and it�۪s illegal. Just about a year ago, the Treasury Department announced its trigger price system. It calculated the real cost of making steel in the most efficient mills���Japan�۪s���and any steel imported below that price was to trigger ail immediate dumping investigation. It was an ingenious idea. Unfortunately, it did not foresee the drastic rise in the value of the Japanese yen throughout 1978.</br></br>As the yen soared, it took the trigger prices up \v ith it. Knowing that their foreign competitors would not come into this country below the trigger price, the American companies raised their own prices right along with the triggers. The trigger system became, in a manner of speaking, price controls in reverse. Instead of a ceiling holding prices down, for the American producers it provided a floor under prices���and, as in an elevator, the floor was rising. The whole trigger experiment has become another painful example of the truth that protectionism is highly inflationary.</br></br>reaction to the closing of steel mills in Ohio�۪s Mahoning Valley, around Youngstown. The closings were blamed on the imports, and the first reports indicated vast unemployment and unbearable hardship for whole communities. But time has passed, and it has become obvious that the social impact of the closings was greatly overestimated. The current unemployment rate there is less than one percentage point higher than the national average. While the inflationary costs of the trigger prices have swollen far beyond any expectation, the social distress caused by the shutdowns of those obsolescent mills in Ohio turns out to have been, happily, much more shortlived than anyone could have hoped a year ago.</br></br>What comes next? On Jan. 1, OPEC imposes a 5 percent increase. It�۪s the first of four increments scheduled for 1979. On the same day, the Treasury has announced, the steel trigger prices will go up another 7 percent under the automatic formula. The industry has already indicated that it will follow with price increases in the range of 3.5 percent. While the causes of these rises in oil and steel prices are different, the effects will be remarkably similar.",,,

The next few weeks are also a make-or-break period for retailers because they count on holiday sales to help pay their costs the rest of the year.</br></br>""With the news of the economy, I wasn't certain of what to expect today,"" said Chris Poleto, general manager of Fair Oaks Mall.

Short-term rental agreements are no more conducive to new office construction than spot prices for electric power are to the building of new power plants."" A copy of the text was released in Washington.</br></br>California's energy problems appear to be easing, but they still represent a ""worrisome situation for Californians, certainly,"" Greenspan said.

Fortunately, the overall effects on the California economy, and on those of its neighboring states, seems to have been modest, at least to date.""</br></br>Greenspan noted that large increases in the cost of gasoline and other petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity have hurt the U.S. economy in several ways. The most significant is the reduced profitability of non-energy firms, which has forced many companies to reduce spending for new plants and equipment.</br></br>""As best we can infer, a substantial part of the rise in the total costs of corporations between the second quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year reflected higher energy costs, only a small part of which companies apparently were able to pass through into higher prices"" of the things they sell, he said.",,,

The dollar has fallen about one-third against the unified European currency over the past three years -- 15 percent this year alone. In the past 23 months, the dollar has slid 11 percent against all the world's currencies, according to Stephen S. Roach, chief global economist at Morgan Stanley & Co.</br></br>For now, economists say, the decline has on balance been a boon to the U.S. economy, pushing the price of American-made goods and services lower on the international market, stimulating exports while trimming imports. Indeed, the economic forecasting firm Global Insight Inc. has calculated that the dollar's decline has saved as many as 700,000 manufacturing jobs since the slide began in earnest two years ago. And as long as inflation stays low, there will be little pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise short-term rates from their historic lows.</br></br>But concerns are growing, especially on Wall Street, that the dollar's slide will inevitably drive up long-term interest rates, and some analysts think the decline could even force the Fed to raise the rates it targets.

830985352,4,6/18/89,Bush's Real Challenge: Rebuilding The Economy,"IT'S TIME for George Bush to revive an old romance. Nineteen years ago, when he had just lost a Senate race in Texas, Bush was looking for work. Come to the White House as congressional liaison, suggested Richard Nixon, who had encouraged the Texas race. No thanks, said Bush, uninterested in a staff job. Well, how about the United Nations? Okay, said Bush, and with that he launched an international career that put him on the road to the presidency.</br></br>But what did Bush himself want in those days? Sources from the Nixon White House say that he had an entirely different path in mind, far from diplomacy and maybe even politics. His first choice was a top post at the Treasury Department, drawing upon his days as an oilman and as a member of the House Ways and Means Committee. Bush hoped that Nixon would eventually make him secretary of the treasury, where he could spruce up the American economy.</br></br>Though he hasn't been a close student of the economy since then, Bush could now serve both himself and the country if he returned to his old interest in economic affairs. Not this week, nor this month, but by fall, he should come to the country with a giant plan for economic renewal. For both Bush and the economy, this is an ideal time to strike.</br></br>Over the past four weeks, Bush has vaulted into his strongest political position since taking office. His arms proposal in Europe not only transformed his first serious trip overseas but seemed to liberate him from a cautious past. Since then he has put together a string of successes: his deft handling of the China crisis, a clean-air proposal, blockage of a minimum-wage proposal and House passage of most of his S&L bailout plan. A Gallup Poll taken in early June showed his popularity climbing 14 points to a 70 percent approval rating-and that was before his call for cleaner air, a sure winner. After a dangerously slow start, Bush may now begin a second honeymoon.</br></br>By chance, the president has seized the high ground just as Congress is falling off the charts in public esteem, badly damaged by the uproar over ethics, pay and unprecedented resignations. While the Democrats have now elected stronger House leaders, they are likely to be far more conciliatory than anyone imagined six months ago. Reagan was more formidable than Bush in his first year, but he could never fully reverse the post-Vietnam flow of power away from the White House. Bush just might-if he now moves to set a more ambitious agenda.",,,

830985532,4,4/12/98,Funds That Show Power of Just One,"As the Dow Jones industrial average hurtles toward 10,000, putting journalists in a quandary about whether to use a comma, investors are pouring more and more money into mutual funds -- a record $37.5 billion in net new cash in March. In 1980, fund investments totaled $100 billion in 12 million accounts; today, $5 trillion in 170 million accounts.</br></br>Still, the majority of Americans have exactly zero dollars invested in the stock market. Some of them simply don't have the money, but many others are confused and scared, and don't know where to begin. They think they need special expertise, and they worry about being burned by unscrupulous brokers or stock manipulators. That's a shame, considering how easy it has become to own stocks and how fair and efficient our markets are.</br></br>The best way to get into the stock market is to buy shares in an equity mutual fund, which is a portfolio of stocks chosen by a professional manager. When you own a share in a fund, you own pieces of all the stocks in the portfolio. While I think it's a good idea to own three or four funds, it's possible -- even prudent -- to own just one. But which fund? That is this week's question, both for investment novices and for more seasoned mavens who want to ponder an interesting intellectual question.</br></br>Here is what I want in just-one-fund: relatively low risk; broad exposure to stocks, including at least a few international ones; strong, consistent performance; and a seasoned manager. I'd like to beat the market, but with few unsettling dips. The ideal fund would not be too big. New research from Morningstar Mutual Funds shows that returns decline as oversized large-cap funds (but, curiously, not small-cap funds) grow to behemoths. Also, expenses should be reasonable, and turnover (which boosts tax bills) should be relatively low.</br></br>One of the few funds that meets these criteria is Dreyfus Disciplined Stock (1-800-645-6561), which has two of my favorite words in its title. The manager, Bert Mullins, has been running the fund since it began 10 years ago under the aegis of Mellon Bank Corp., a conservative Pittsburgh-based institution that merged recently with Dreyfus. Mellon had only a few funds, which were excellent but poorly marketed. Dreyfus had lots of funds, many of which were not stellar performers but were brilliantly sold. It was a match made in Wall Street heaven.",,,

830985624,5,1/29/06,The Great Terror,,"Looking at the enormous -- and incessant -- tide of books and articles written about Hitler and the Third Reich, we may note an interesting discrepancy. The majority of non-German historians and authors have devoted and are still devoting their main interests to Hitler's war and crimes, to the second six years of the Reich, 1939- 45. The majority of German historians and authors have devoted their main interests to topics and themes about the first six years, 1933- 39. This is understandable. In 1939 Hitler chose war, with the results of total defeat for Germany and Germans. But what led up to that? What happened to the German people before that fatal turning point?</br></br>The Third Reich in Power is Richard J. Evans's attempt to answer many of those questions through historical synthesis. The second part of this British historian's planned three-volume history of Nazi Germany, it is crammed with information (data, statistics, official and private records and reminiscences), sustained by the author's knowledge of German and his acquaintance with all kinds of German sources, many of them relatively recent ones. This heavy volume amounts to something like a massive handbook of a very big subject. It consists of seven large parts, made up of four chapters each, moving from the history of the Nazi police state to that of propaganda, religion, artistic and intellectual life, economy and finance, class structure, Jews and finally ""The Road to War"" -- that is, Hitler's foreign policy.</br></br>Yet there are things wrong with both the content and the writing of this massive book. Its long chapters about economics, finance and nationalization of German industry, detailing their difficulties, miss the essence of Hitler's thinking. ""Why should I nationalize the industry?"" he once said. ""I shall nationalize the people"" -- which is what he did (alas, quite successfully). Compared to that, Evans's citing of the occasional private grumblings of industrialists such as Gustav Krupp are largely devoid of meaning.</br></br>His judgments are sometimes contradictory. On page 370, he writes that ""the economy was clearly in no shape to sustain a prolonged conflict in 1938-1939."" (""Clearly""? And did Hitler plan for ""a prolonged conflict""?) But on page 409, he states that ""the economy had recovered from the Depression faster than its counterparts in other countries. Germany's foreign debt had been stabilized, interest rates had fallen to half their 1932 level, the stock exchange had recovered from the Depression, the gross national product had risen by 81 per cent over the same period. . . . Inflation and unemployment had been conquered."" Another contradiction: ""Everything that happened in the Third Reich took place in this pervasive atmosphere of fear and terror, which never slackened and indeed became far more intense towards the end."" Yet on many other pages, Evans mentions umpteen examples of the regime relenting its pressures for tactical purposes (for example, before and during the 1936 Berlin Olympics).</br></br>This heavy book is chock-full with statistics. Yet there is no mention of such very telling numbers as the increase in German marriages from about 511,000 in 1932 to 611,000 in 1936; the jump from 921,000 births in 1932 to 1,280,000 in 1936, meaning that for every two children born in Germany in 1932, three were born just four years later; the fact that in 1938 and 1939, most marriages in all of Europe were registered in Germany, exceeding the numbers among even the prolific people of Eastern Europe; or the statistic that suicides committed by young people under 20 dropped by 80 percent (!) during the first six years of the Hitler regime -- all symptoms of a great and ominous rise of German national confidence.",,
